    "text": "In the Pacific Northwest, there are currently 17 distinct population segments (DPS) or evolutionarily significant units (ESUs)[^2] of Pacific salmon and steelhead listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (Table 1). The ESA requires that the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) review the status of listed species under its authority at least every five years and determine whether any species should be removed from the list or have its listing status changed. The most recent such review for ESA listed salmon in the Pacific Northwest occurred in 2016 (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/action/2016-5-year-reviews-28-listed-species-pacific-salmon-steelhead-and-eulachon). NMFS is again conducting such a review in 2020/21 (84 FR 53117).\nThe NMFS West Coast Region is responsible for the 5-year review process for Pacific salmon and steelhead and for decision-making regarding any proposed changes in listing status. This report provides updated information and analyses on the biological viability of the listed species, focusing primarily on trends and status in abundance, productivity, spatial structure and diversity. In some cases, the report considers new information available on ESU or population boundaries. Where possible, this review also summarizes current information with respect to recovery goals identified in recovery plans or Technical Recovery Team viability documents.\nIn three prior viability reports that supported the current listings NWFSC (2015) the report categorized each ESU as either “in danger of extinction”, “likely to become endangered” or “not likely to become endangered”, based on the ESU’s abundance, productivity, spatial structure and diversity. In a fourth report (Oregon Coast coho salmon; Stout et al. (2012) ), the three categories were instead referred to as “high”, “moderate” and “low” risk, and included narrative definitions for the “high” and “moderate” risk categories (see p. 114 of Stout et al. 2012). In this report we use the “high”, “moderate”, “low” risk categories of Stout et al. (2012). In addition, we also note whether the viability of each ESU appears to be unchanged, improving, or declining, even if the magnitude of the change is not sufficient to warrant a move among the three risk categories (Table 1). The information in the report will be incorporated into the Region’s review, and the Region will make final determinations about whether changes in listing status are or are not warranted, taking into account not only biological information but also ongoing or planned protective efforts and recovery actions.\nSeveral ESU/DPS were evaluated to have a declining trend in overall status since the last review (Table 1). Upper Willamette steelhead and Chinook salmon were judged to have declining viability due to chronically declining abundance and persistent concerns regarding spatial structure and diversity. Snake River sockeye was judged to have a declining viability trend, the result of abundance declines combined with very high vulnerability to climate change. In contrast, a few ESU/DPS were evaluated to be improving in viability. Lower Columbia Chinook salmon were judged to have an increasing viability trend, the result of natural spawner increases in multiple populations combined with dramatic improvements in the fraction natural origin spawners in several populations. Columbia River chum also showed marked improvement in abundance for several extant populations, although many historical populations remain extirpated or at extremely low abundance. Puget Sound steelhead also showed some evidence of improving viability, with the reversal of some previous strong negative trends.\nTable – Summary of current ESA listing status, recent trends and summary of conclusions\n\nTable . 15-year trends in log natural spawner abundance computed from a linear regression applied to the smoothed natural spawner log abundance estimate.

The demographics of a species/DPS at such a high level of risk may be highly uncertain and strongly influenced by stochastic or depensatory processes. Similarly, a species/DPS may be at high risk of extinction if it faces clear and present threats (e.g., confinement to a small geographic area, imminent destruction, modification or curtailment of its habitat, or disease epidemic) that are likely to create such imminent demographic risk. Moderate risk: A DPS or ESU is at moderate risk of extinction if it exhibits a trajectory indicating that it is more likely than not to be at a high level of extinction risk within 30-80 years. A DPS/ESU may be at moderate risk of extinction due to projected threats or declining trends in abundance, productivity, spatial structure, or diversity. Low risk: neither moderate nor high risk.\n\n\n\n\nGood, T. P., R. S. Waples, and P. Adams. 2005. Updated status of federally listed ESUs of West Coast salmon and steelhead.

    "text": "2.1 Spawning abundance and trends\nAll of the Pacific Northwest TRTs spent considerable time and effort developing spawning abundance data for the populations they identified within ESUs. In almost all cases these estimates are derived from state, tribal or federal monitoring programs. The raw information upon which the spawning abundance estimates were developed consists of numerous types of data, including redd counts, dam counts, carcass surveys, information on pre-spawning mortality, and distribution within populations, which the TRTs used to develop estimates of natural origin spawning abundance. It is important to recognize that spawning abundance estimates and related information such as the fraction of spawners that are natural origin are not in most cases ‘facts’ that are known with certainty. Rather, they typically are estimates based on a variety of sources of information, some known with greater precision or accuracy than others. Ideally, these estimates would be characterized by a good understanding of the degree of variation due to measurement error. However, for the most part such a statistical characterization is either not possible or has not been attempted, although many improvements have been made in the last decade (see specific chapters for details). The spawning time series summarized here and references to the methods and sources for their development are available from the Northwest Fisheries Science Center’s Salmon Population Summary database and are also discussed in the ESU-specific chapters."

    "section": "2.2 Common metrics",
    "text": "2.2 Common metrics\nMultivariate dynamic linear modeling (DLM) was used to estimate population-specific mean trends in each ESU from the log of total spawner counts. The result is an estimate of the mean or smoothed total spawner counts, from which summary statistics regarding trends were computed. We focus exclusively on fish spawning in nature, but often these naturally spawning populations include some numbers of hatchery-origin fish, either as part of a deliberate supplementation effort or due to straying from hatchery programs. For the rest of this report, a “natural-origin” or “wild” fish refers to a fish whose parents spawned naturally, and a “hatchery-origin” fish refers to a fish whose parents were spawned in a hatchery, regardless of prior generation origin.\nIn order to estimate the trend of natural-origin spawners in populations that also include hatchery-origin spawners, a univariate DLM was applied to the logit of the fraction natural-origin estimate to produce a smoothed proportion natural-origin time series. This was used to produce an estimate of the mean natural-origin spawners for years when fraction natural-origin estimates were unavailable.\nThe mean or smoothed total spawner count is similar in concept to a 3- or 5-year geometric mean; the goal is the same—to produce an estimate that smooths over single year variation. Such variation arises from observation error in the spawning counts and also from peaks and troughs in spawners numbers due to the life-history of salmonids or environmental variation. The multivariate DLM approach has a number of advantages. Most importantly it is a statistical model for which maximum-likelihood diagnostics, model selection criteria, and confidence intervals are available. It is a time-series model, which addresses temporal autocorrelation in the data. Where there are missing data, it provides an estimate for the missing year with appropriately wider confidence intervals. And lastly, it allows us to use information across all populations within an ESU to estimate the level of year-to-year variation in the mean spawner count—the process variance—and allows us to estimate the year-to-year covariance, which is often high, across populations within an ESU. The latter improves estimation of missing values because populations with data in one year help inform the values for populations with missing data that year."

    "text": "2.3 Dynamic linear modeling for time-varying trend estimation\nDynamic linear models (DLMs) are similar to linear regression models with a yearly trend. Like a classic trend analysis using linear regression, the goal is to estimate the mean spawner count at x, where x is year (time). Linear regression models, however, use a time-constant yearly trend (which appears as the regression line versus time) while DLMs allow the trend to be time-varying.\nIn mathematical terms this means that the classic linear regression of log spawners (y) against year treats the trend (β) or yearly growth in the mean spawner count as a constant and fits the following model:\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere ytare the observations, yt is the mean of yt and vt are normal-distributed errors. The mean spawner count in year t is the mean spawner count in year t− 1 plus the constant trend value β. Normally, we write this model in classic linear regression form as\n\n\n\n\n\nwith the mean of yt equal to α + βt. A DLM, in contrast, allows us to fit a model with a time-varying β. Specifically, the following model\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time-varying β is modeled as u + wt, where wt is a normally distributed random variable.\nFigure 1 shows example spawner data where a time-varying sinusoidal β (yearly growth rate) was used to generate counts (the circles) using the DLM model above. The black line in the top panel of Figure 1 shows the true mean y. The red line shows the estimate from a linear regression of y against year with a non-time-varying β. The blue line shows the estimate from a DLM where the β is allowed to vary in time. The bottom panel shows the estimate of β compared to the true sinusoidal β that generated the data. This illustrates the power of DLM when the objective is to estimate a time-varying trend."

Specifically, one can constrain the variances to be the same across time series and to allow covariance across time series. The latter allows information from time series with data in year t to help inform the estimate of mean y for time series that have no data in year t. The multivariate DLM allowed us to use all spawner count information in the ESU to deal with measurement error in the spawner count data and more importantly to estimate missing spawner count data.\nMathematically, the model being fit is\n\n\n\n\n\nThe uj are the long-term mean of βj,t .

    "text": "2.5 Model selection\nModel selection was used to select the structure of Q and R. The following structures were explored for Q: diagonal with unequal variances (no covariance across populations in terms of good and bad years and populations allowed to have different year-to-year variability), diagonal with equal variances (no covariance across populations and populations constrained to have the same year-to-year variability), one variance and one covariance across all populations, equal variances and covariances across similar run timings in a population, and unconstrained (unique variances and covariances across all populations). For R the following structures were explored: diagonal with unequal variances (no covariance) and diagonal with equal variances. The R represents the residual non-time-dependent error and was assumed not to covary across populations (Q and R cannot both have covariance terms in the DLM due to identifiability constraints). Across the majority of ESUs, model selection gave the most data support (quantified with AICc) to a Q with one variance and one covariance across all populations in an ESU and an R, the residual variance-covariance matrix, with one variance across populations. Because Q has covariance terms, estimates of mean spawner numbers can be provided for populations with missing data because the data from other populations helps inform the estimates (Figure 2 shows an example).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure compares a trend analysis using a non-time-varying trend (red line) via linear regression versus a trend analysis using a time-varying trend (blue line). The black line is the true line we are trying to estimate (with the red or blue line) and the dots in the top panel are the observations of the black line. In the top plot, y is the log-spawners. The trend in the lower plot is the yearly change in log-spawners.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Code to fit a multivariate DLM\nThe MARSS R package was used to fit multivariate DLMs to the log-spawner counts (or indices in some cases).

    "text": "2.6 Natural-origin spawner estimates\nFor some populations, there were estimates of the fraction of total natural spawners that were of natural-origin. However, for many populations, these data were noisy and had many missing years. In addition, the number of years with fraction natural-origin information was often shorter than the years with total spawner counts. To estimate a mean natural-origin spawner estimate, similar to the mean total spawner estimate, the mean total spawner estimate was multiplied by a smoothed estimate of the fraction natural-origin. The smoothed estimate was produced by fitting a univariate DLM to the logit zt = log(f /(1 − f )) of the fraction natural-origin estimates with a time-varying β. Specifically, the following model was fit:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean natural-origin spawner estimate at time t was then y¯t exp(z¯t )/(exp(z¯t )+ 1). Each time series of fraction natural-origin from each population was fit independently (no covariance assumed across populations). Missing values were allowed within the fraction natural-origin time series and would be estimated by the DLM, however no estimates were used more than 1-year before the available data or 1-year after. For example, if the natural origin data started in 2001, then the first DLM estimate would be for 2000. This prevents the model from extrapolating too far outside the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimated mean log (spawners) using a multivariate DLM.

The definition of ‘spawner’ with respect to age varied somewhat across data sources and was dependent in some cases upon decisions made by data providers. For Chinook salmon, jacks (males one year younger than the model age) were included as spawners in most cases but ‘mini-jacks’ (males two or more years younger than the model age) were never included. Jacks were not included for coho salmon. For steelhead, only anadromous spawners were included.\nThese metrics are similar to statistics reported in prior viability reports and provide a common set of relatively simple metrics for comparison across all ESU/DPS and populations and with prior reports. In most cases, there are also ESU/DPS-specific metrics that were developed by technical recovery teams and/or included in recovery plans. Where feasible, these metrics are also reported in the individual ESU/DPS chapters.\n15-year trends.  A linear regression was fit to 15 years of the mean natural origin spawner DLM estimates and the slope (trend) reported. The 15-year time period was chosen to remain consistent with prior viability reports and does not necessarily correspond to any peaks or troughs in the time series.\n5-year geometric means.  5-year geometric means (y1y2y3 y4y5)(1/5) were computed from the raw total natural spawner and natural origin spawner DLM estimates. The raw data could have missing values in the calculation, while the DLM estimates would not. For the raw estimates, when there were missing values, the geometric mean was computed only from the non-missing values. For example, if 3 values were available, (y1y2y3)(1/3) was reported.\nAverage fraction natural origin.  These were computed over 5-year time frames from the raw estimates of fraction natural-origin.\nProductivity metric. Because age of return data were not consistently available across all ESUs and populations, a generic productivity metric was computed as the mean natural-origin spawner DLM estimate at year t divided by the mean total spawner DLM estimate at year t − 3 for coho salmon and t − 4 for all other species. This metric was plotted for all years of available data.\nHarvest. We compiled data on trends in the adult equivalent exploitation rate for each ESU. This information was used to provide some additional context for interpreting abundance trends, similar to the environmental trend information we also report. It is important to note that magnitude and trend of an exploitation rate cannot be interpreted uncritically as a trend in level of risk from harvest. Analyses relating exploitation rate to extinction risk or recovery probability have been conducted in a quantitative way for several ESUs ( e.g., NMFS 2001; Ford et al. 2007; NWFSC 2010) and qualitatively for others (NMFS 2004).

Our approach to assessing the current viability of a steelhead DPS is based on evaluating information on the abundance, productivity, spatial structure and diversity of the anadromous component of the species (Good et al. 2005; 85 FR 81822). Many steelhead populations along the West Coast of the U.S. co-occur with conspecific populations of resident rainbow trout. We recognize that there may be situations where reproductive contributions from resident rainbow trout may mitigate short-term extinction risk for some steelhead DPSs (Good et al. 2005); 85 FR 81822). We assume that any benefits to an anadromous population resulting from the presence of a conspecific resident form will be reflected in direct measures of the current viability of the anadromous form."

    "text": "4.2 Summary of previous viability conclusions\n2005\nThe 2005 BRT cited low growth rate/productivity as the most serious risk factor for the Upper Columbia River steelhead DPS (Good et al. 2005). In particular, the BRT concluded that the extremely low replacement rate of natural spawners highlighted in the 1998 review continued through the subsequent brood cycle. The 2005 BRT assessment also identified very low natural spawner abundance compared to interim escapement objectives and high levels of hatchery spawners in natural areas as contributing risk factors. The 2005 BRT report did note that the number of naturally produced steelhead returning to spawn within this DPS had increased over the levels reported in the 1998 status review. As with the Mid-Columbia and Snake River DPS reviews, the 2005 BRT recognized that resident O. mykiss were associated with anadromous steelhead production areas for this DPS. The review stated that the presence of resident O. mykiss was considered a mitigating factor by many of the BRT members in rating extinction risk.\n2010\nThe 2010 status review update reported that Upper Columbia steelhead populations had increased in natural origin abundance in recent years, but productivity levels remained low (Ford et al. 2011). The proportions of hatchery origin returns in natural spawning areas remained extremely high across the DPS, especially in the Methow and Okanogan River populations. The modest improvements in natural returns that had been observed the years prior to the review were probably primarily the result of several years of relatively good natural survival in the ocean and tributary habitats. Tributary habitat actions called for in the Upper Columbia Recovery Plan were anticipated to be implemented over the next 25 years and the benefits of some of those actions would require some time to be realized. Overall, the new information considered did not indicate a change in the biological risk category since the time of the last BRT status review.\n2015\nBased on the review in 2015, Upper Columbia River steelhead populations were determined to have increased relative to the low levels observed in the 1990s, but natural origin abundance and productivity remained well below viability thresholds for three out of the four populations (NWFSC 2015). The viability of the Wenatchee River steelhead population continued to improve based on the additional years information available for this review. The abundance and productivity viability rating for the Wenatchee River exceeds the minimum threshold for 5% extinction risk. However, the overall DPS viability remains unchanged from the prior review, remaining at high risk driven by low abundance and productivity relative to viability objectives and diversity concerns. Application of the criteria for abundance/productivity results in relatively coarse scale ratings for each population. Across Interior Columbia DPSs, the populations differ in the relative changes in survival or limiting capacities that could lead to viable ratings. The required improvement to improve the abundance/productivity estimates for Upper Columbia Steelhead populations is at the high end of the range for all listed Interior populations."

    "text": "4.3 Description of new data available for this review\nThe 2015 NWFSC status review (NWFSC 2015) evaluated the viability of the Upper Columbia Steelhead DPS based on data series through cycle year 2013/2014 for each of the four extant populations, along with sampling information collected at Priest Rapids Dam for the aggregate return to the Upper Columbia Basin and Wells Dam (Methow and Okanogan populations combined). Estimates generated using that methodology are currently available through the 2018/2019 cycle years for each population. Spawning escapement estimates are based on a run reconstruction model incorporating annual dam counts, results of a three year radio tracking program and estimates of broodstock and fisheries removals in various reaches above Rock Island Dam. Estimates are generated by WDFW regional staff (incorporating information from the Colville Tribal Fish & Wildlife Department) and are available through the StreamNet Coordinated Assessment Project website. An updated approach for estimating population level escapements has been initiated in recent years. That approach uses mark/recapture statistics based on data generated from the combination of systematic PIT tagging of a target proportion of the returns passing Rock Island Dam (below all four population spawning tributaries) and subsequent detections at arrays in each of the tributaries (Waterhouse et al. 2020). Comparisons of the results from the updated approach with the methods used in prior years indicate they generally produce compatible estimates for a given year. Preliminary results are included in this assessment, in parallel to the ongoing data collection based population assessments, with the understanding that ongoing methodological and data evaluations will result in a single approach to annual population enumeration in the future.\nSmolt to Adult Return and Recruits per Spawner Rates\nSmolt to Adult Return (SAR) estimates (Bonneville to Bonneville) for all four Upper Columbia River Steelhead population data series are generated by the Columbia River Data Access in Real Time (CBR, 2020) project using PIT tag detections from all release locations within each population basin (Columbia River DART, 2020). The indices represent cumulative marine, nearshore and estuary survival. The SAR series includes estimates for the range of brood years 2002-2015 (Figure 11). Over the period of record, the geometric mean SAR for the Entiat, Methow and Okanogan populations (~3%) represents a low, but reasonable marine survival (2% is generally considered a minimal replacement rate), with the Wenatchee SAR of ~5% being a robust rate for a stable population. Recruits per Spawner (R/S) indices are reported as available from the StreamNet Coordinated Assessments data portal (StreamNet, 2020a). All populations in the ESU have low (< 1.0) R/S values, implying that the natural replacement rate is not keeping up with all sources of mortality across the life-cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Smolt to Adult Return and Recruits per Spawner for each of the populations in the ESU. Geometric means of SAR and R/S are shown for each population, along with the standard error of the estimate (whiskers represent +/- one standard error). The time period included in the SAR or R/S indices is the past 20 years, depending on data availability.\n\n\n\n\nOcean Condition Indices\nJuvenile steelhead are more pelagic than salmon, heading off the continental shelf soon after entering the ocean in the spring (Burgner 1992). Steelhead migrate seasonally across the North Pacific Ocean, moving to the north and west in spring and to the south and east, across the entire Pacific, from autumn through winter (Atcheson et al. 2012). Thus, steelhead ocean survival may be impacted by different factors than salmon. In fact, recent work has shown steelhead population groupings from geographic regions have unique smolt survival trends that appear to be driven by factors affecting them early in their ocean residence despite steelhead smolts generally being larger than Pacific salmon smolts when they enter the ocean and all making wide-ranging, off the continental shelf migrations, rather than remaining more coastal, as Pacific salmon smolts tend to do (Kendall et al. 2017).\nAggregate annual returns of Columbia River steelhead are correlated with a range of ocean condition indices including measures of broad scale physical conditions, local biological indicators, and local physical factors (Peterson et al. 2014a). Work is ongoing to relate indices of ocean condition to steelhead populations up and down the West Coast. Steelhead marine survival seems to be related to ocean surface temperature in the first summer of ocean entry, and populations respond similarly to spatial patterns of ocean conditions at a rough grain of 250km between ocean entry points (Kendall et al. 2017). Therefore, broad spatial patterns of ocean conditions may not capture the finer spatial scale of response that steelhead seem to exhibit.\nIndicators of ocean condition are highly correlated with each other, and exhibit strong temporal autocorrelation (Figure 129, (Peterson et al. 2019)). As a result, when indicators point to conditions that result in poor ocean productivity for salmonid populations, they do so as a suite of indicators, and for runs of ‘good’ or ‘bad’ years (see Habitat chapter). Historically, ocean conditions cycled between periods of high and low productivity. However, global climate change is likely to disrupt this pattern, in general, leading to a preponderance of low productivity years, with an unknown temporal distribution (Crozier et al. 2019b). Recent (2015-2019) ensemble ocean indicators rankings include four of the worst seven years in the past 20, meaning that an entire salmon or steelhead generation could have been subjected to poor ocean productivity conditions."

    "section": "4.4 Abundance and productivity",
    "text": "4.4 Abundance and productivity\nUpdated data series on spawner abundance, age structure and hatchery wild proportions were used to generate current assessments of abundance and productivity at the population level. Evaluations were done using both a set of metrics corresponding to those used in prior ESA Status Reviews as well as a set corresponding to the specific viability criteria based on ICTRT recommendations for this DPS. The standard Status Review metrics were consistently done across all ESUs and DPSs to facilitate comparisons across domains. Assessments using the ICTRT metrics are described in the TRT and Recovery Plan Criteria section below. The ICTRT abundance and productivity metrics are measured over longer time frames to dampen the effects of annual variations and they use annual natural origin age composition to calculate brood year recruitment when sampling levels meet regional fishery agency criteria.\nThe most recent estimates (5-year geometric mean) of total and natural-origin spawner abundance have declined dramatically, erasing gains observed over the past two decades for all four populations (Figure 12, Table 6). Recent declines are persistent and large enough to result in small, but negative 15-year trends in abundance for all four populations (Table 7). Updated spawner estimation methods show a strong concordance with existing methods (Figure 13), which is extremely encouraging as the estimation process based on detecting tags from a run-at-large tagging program is a very robust approach to monitoring across the DPS. Annual brood year return-per-spawner estimates have been well below replacement in recent years for all four populations. The return per spawner estimates summarized in Figure 14 are ratios of the estimated natural origin returns produced from spawners in each brood year, under the assumption that both hatchery and natural origin fish contribute to production as parent spawners. All populations are consistently exhibiting natural production rates well below replacement, and natural production has also declined consistently, resulting in an increasing fraction of hatchery fish on the spawning grounds each year.\nThe required improvement to increase abundance and productivity for Upper Columbia Steelhead populations is at the high end of the range for all listed Interior populations. Using the R/S and SAR indicators by population (Figure 15), it is possible to generate an indicator of fresh water productivity (FWPI) as a ratio of R/S and SAR. This quantity can be thought of as an indicator of smolts per spawner, and thus, the overall population productivity in the freshwater environment. FWPI for Upper Columbia steelhead populations are very low (<<100, Figure 15), confirming areas of recovery action focus such as pre-spawn mortality and juvenile rearing habitat condition, as well as mainstem migratory impacts as the SAR are based on Bonneville to Bonneville tag detections and the R/S are based on spawning ground recruits. The initial ICTRT assessment of abundance/productivity gaps resulted in a pattern similar to that indicated by the long-term productivity metrics (ICTRT 2007,). The Wenatchee River population has somewhat higher productivity (SAR, R/S, and FWPI) than the remaining populations in the DPS, but still falls into a high risk category due to the recent downward trend in both abundance and productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Traditionally generated spawner abundance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) PIT tag based\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Smoothed trend in estimated total (thick black line, with 95% confidence internal in gray) and natural (thin red line) population spawning abundance.

    "text": "4.5 Spatial structure and diversity\nWith the exception of the Okanogan population, the upper Columbia River populations were rated as low risk for spatial structure. The high risk ratings for diversity are largely driven by high levels of hatchery spawners within natural spawning areas and lack of genetic diversity among the populations. The basic major life history patterns (summer A-run type, tributary and mainstem spawning/rearing patterns, and the presence of resident populations and subpopulations) appear to be present. All of the populations were rated at high risk for current genetic characteristics by the ICTRT. Genetics samples taken in the 1980s indicate little differentiation within populations in the upper Columbia River DPS. More recent studies within the Wenatchee River basin have found differences between samples from the Peshastin River, believed to be relatively isolated from hatchery spawning, and those from other reaches within the Wenatchee. This suggests that there may have been a higher level of within and among population diversity prior to the advent of major hatchery releases (Seamons et al. 2012). Genetic studies based on sampling in the Wenatchee as well as other Upper Columbia River steelhead population tributaries are underway and should allow for future analyses of current genetic structure and any impacts of changing hatchery release practices.\nHatchery-origin returns continue to constitute a high fraction of total spawners in natural spawning areas for this DPS (Table 8). The estimated proportion of natural-origin spawners has increased consistently since the late 1990s for all four populations (Figure 16). Natural-origin proportions were the highest in the Wenatchee River (58%). Although increasing, natural origin proportions in the Methow and Okanogan rivers remained at low levels. There are currently direct releases of hatchery origin juveniles in three of the four populations, the exception being the Entiat River. Based on PIT detections, hatchery origin spawners in the Entiat River include stray hatchery returns from releases into the Wenatchee River (Hillman et al. 2015). Reproductive effectiveness studies on the Wenatchee population indicate that hatchery-hatchery matings have dramatically reduced fitness compared to matings among natural-origin fish (Ford et al. 2016), reinforcing the weight the ICTRT placed on the presence of hatchery origin spawners in the Spatial Structure and Diversity metric.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Smoothed trend in the estimated fraction of the natural spawning population consisting of fish if natural origin.

There is incidental mortality associated with mark-selective recreational fisheries.

    "section": "4.7 Biological viability relative to recovery goals",
    "text": "4.7 Biological viability relative to recovery goals\nNOAA Fisheries adopted a recovery plan for upper Columbia River spring Chinook salmon and steelhead in 2007 (FR 72 #194, 57303−57307). The plan was developed by the Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Board (UCSRB) and is available at: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/recovery-plan-upper-columbia-spring-chinook-salmon-and-steelhead.\nAchieving recovery (delisting) of each ESU via sufficient improvement in abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity is the longer term goal of the UC Recovery Plan. The UC Recovery Plan includes specific quantitative criteria expressed relative to population viability curves (ICTRT 2007). It includes two quantitative criteria for assessing the viability of the steelhead DPS against the recovery objective: “The 12-year geometric mean (representing approximately three generations) of abundance and productivity of naturally produced steelhead within the Wenatchee, Entiat, and Methow populations must reach a level that would have not less than a 5% extinction-risk (viability) over a 100 year period” and “at a minimum, the Upper Columbia Steelhead DPS will maintain at least 3,000 naturally produced spawners and a spawner:spawner ratio greater than 1:1 distributed among the three populations.” The minimum number of naturally produced spawners (expressed as 12-year geometric means) should exceed 1,000 each for the Wenatchee and Methow river populations and 500 each for the Entiat and Okanogan river populations. The plan also established minimum productivity thresholds. These natural spawner abundance criteria replace the interim targets referenced in the 2005 BRT report. The 12-year geometric mean productivity should exceed 1.1 spawners per parent spawner for the two larger populations (Wenatchee and Methow Rivers), and 1.2 for the smaller Entiat River and Okanogan populations.\nThe ICTRT had recommended that at least two of the four extant populations be targeted for highly viable status (less than 1% risk of extinction over 100 years) because of the relatively low number of extant populations remaining in the DPS. The UC Recovery Plan adopted an alternative approach for addressing the limited number of populations in the DPS—5% or less risk of extinction for at least three of the four extant populations.\nThe UC Recovery Plan also calls for “… restoring the distribution of naturally produced spring Chinook salmon and steelhead to previously occupied areas where practical, and conserving their genetic and phenotypic diversity.” Specific criteria included in the UC Recovery Plan reflect a combination of the criteria recommended by the ICTRT (ICTRT 2007) and an earlier pre-TRT analytical project (Ford et al. 2001). The plan incorporates spatial structure criteria specific to each steelhead population. For the Wenatchee River population, the criteria require observed natural spawning in four of the five major spawning areas as well as in at least one of the minor spawning areas downstream of Tumwater Dam. In the Methow River, natural spawning should be observed in three major spawning areas. In each case, the major spawning areas should include a minimum of 5% of the total return to the system or 20 redds, whichever is greater. In the Entiat, natural spawning should be observed in both historical major spawning areas, with a distribution criteria similar to the Methow. In the Okanogan, natural spawning should be observed within the two major spawning areas and within at least two of the five minor spawning areas, with a numerical distribution similar to the Methow, across the minor spawning areas. The plan incorporates criteria for spatial structure and diversity adopted from the ICTRT viability report. The mean score for the three metrics representing natural rates and spatially mediated processes should result in a moderate or lower risk in each of the three populations and all threats defined as high risk must be addressed. In addition, the mean score for the eight ICTRT metrics tracking natural levels of variation should result in a moderate or lower risk score at the population level.\n\n\n\n\nTable . 5-year geometric mean of raw natural origin spawner counts.

Ongoing genetic sampling and analysis could provide information in the future to determine if the diversity risk is abating. The proportions of hatchery-origin returns in natural spawning areas remain high across the DPS, especially in the Methow and Okanogan river populations. Tributary habitat actions called for in the Upper Columbia Recovery Plan are anticipated to be implemented over the next 25 years and the benefits of some of those actions will require some time to be realized.\nThe most recent estimates (5-year geometric mean) of total and natural-origin spawner abundance have declined since the last report, largely erasing gains observed over the past two decades for all four populations (Figure 12, Table 6). Recent declines are persistent and large enough to result in small, but negative 15-year trends in abundance for all four populations (Table 7).

    "text": "5.2 Summary of previous viability conclusions\n2005\nIn the 2005 review, a slight majority (53%) of the cumulative votes cast by the BRT members placed this ESU in the “in danger of extinction” category, with the next category, “likely to become endangered”, receiving a substantial number of votes as well (45%) (Good et al. 2005). The 2005 BRT review noted that Upper Columbia Spring Chinook populations had “rebounded somewhat from the critically low levels” observed in the 1998 review. Although the BRT considered this an encouraging sign, they noted that the increase was largely driven by returns in the two most recent spawning years available at the time of the review. The BRT ratings were also influenced by the fact that two out of the three extant populations in this ESU were subject to extreme hatchery intervention measures in response to the extreme downturn in returns during the 1990s. Good et al. (2005) stated that these measures were “...a strong indication of the ongoing risks to this ESU, although the associated hatchery programs may ultimately play a role in helping to restore naturally self-sustaining populations.”\n2010 \nThe viability of the ESU in 2010 was reported in Ford et al. (2011). At that time, the Upper Columbia Spring Chinook ESU was not currently meeting the viability criteria (adapted from the ICTRT) in the Upper Columbia Recovery Plan. Increases in natural origin abundance relative to the extremely low spawning levels observed in the mid-1990s were encouraging; however, average productivity levels remained extremely low. Overall, the report concluded that the viability of the Upper Columbia Spring Chinook salmon ESU had likely improved somewhat since the time of the last BRT status review, but the ESU was still clearly at moderate-to-high risk of extinction.\n2015\nEstimates of natural origin spawner abundance increased relative to the levels observed in the prior reviews for all three extant populations, and productivities were higher for the Wenatchee and Entiat and unchanged for the Methow (NWFSC 2015). However abundance and productivity remained well below the viable thresholds called for in the Upper Columbia Recovery Plan for all three populations. Based on the information available for the 2015 review, the risk category for the Upper Columbia Spring Chinook ESU remained unchanged from the prior review. Although the viability of the ESU is improved relative to measures available at the time of listing, all three populations remain at high risk."

    "text": "5.3 Description of new data available for this review\nAnnual abundance estimates for each of the extant populations in this ESU are generated based on expansions from redd surveys and carcass sampling. Index area redd counts have been conducted in these river systems since the late 1950’s (Mullan et al. 1992). Multiple pass surveys in index areas complemented by supplemental surveys covering the majority of spawning reaches have been conducted since the mid 1980’s. For more recent years, estimates of annual returns to the Wenatchee River population also reflect counts and sampling data obtained at a trap at the Tumwater Dam on the mainstem river downstream of spring Chinook spawning areas. The data series for each population has been updated to include return years through 2019. Recent year estimates of spawner abundance, hatchery and natural origin proportions and age composition were provided by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, recruits per spawner data for these populations was provided by WDFW and distributed through the Coordinated Assessments data web portal, and smolt to adult return rate data were estimated from PIT tag detections and distributed by the Columbia River Data Access in Real Time data portal[^3].\nSmolt to Adult Return and Recruits per Spawner Rates\nSmolt to Adult Return (SAR) estimates (Bonneville to Bonneville) for all three Upper Columbia River Spring Chinook salmon population data series are generated by the Columbia River Data Access in Real Time (CBR & Washington 2020) project using PIT tag detections from all release locations within each population basin (Columbia River DART et al. 2020). The indices represent cumulative marine, nearshore and estuary survival. The SAR series includes estimates for the range of brood years 2002-2015 (Figure 4). Over the period of record, the geometric mean SAR for the Entiat and Methow populations (~3%) represents a low, but reasonable marine survival, with the Wenatchee SAR of ~1.5% being on the low end, as 2% is roughly a replacement rate. Recruits per Spawner (R/S) indices are reported as available from the StreamNet Coordinated Assessments data portal (see footnote). All populations in the ESU have low (< 1.0) R/S values, implying that the natural replacement rate is not keeping up with all sources of mortality across the life-cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Smolt to Adult Return and Recruits per Spawner for each of the populations in the ESU. Geometric means of SAR (%) and R/S (fish/fish) are shown for each population, along with the standard error of the estimate (whiskers represent +/- one standard error). The time period included in the SAR or R/S indices is the past 20 years, depending on data availability.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Ocean Condition Indices\nUpper Columbia spring Chinook salmon are a component of the Columbia River spring Chinook run that is believed to occupy mid-shelf waters during the early ocean life history phase. Aggregate annual returns of Columbia River Spring Chinook are correlated with a range of ocean condition indices including measures of broad scale physical conditions, local biological indicators, and local physical factors (Peterson et al. 2014a). Several indicators, either individually or in combination, correlate well with spring Chinook salmon adult returns with a lag of 1 to 2 years. However, for each specific indicator or combination, there are anomalous years that fall outside of the apparent relationships. Work is continuing to further understand the relationships among physical and biological ‘drivers’ and annual levels of ocean survival for salmonid species in the ocean environment. After accounting for age at return at time of ocean entry, the annual pattern in the Upper Columbia spring Chinook ESU SAR index generally corresponds to the composite rankings across ocean indicators available for early ocean years starting in the late 1990s (Peterson et al. 2014b). Indicators of ocean condition are highly correlated with each other, and exhibit strong temporal autocorrelation (Figure 129) (Peterson et al. 2019). As a result, when indicators point to conditions that result in poor ocean productivity for salmonid populations, they do so as a suite of indicators, and for runs of ‘good’ or ‘bad’ years (see Habitat chapter). Historically, ocean conditions cycled between periods of high and low productivity. However, global climate change is likely to disrupt this pattern, in general, leading to a preponderance of low productivity years, with an unknown temporal distribution (Crozier et al. 2019b). Recent (2015-2019) ensemble ocean indicators rankings include four of the worst seven years in the past 20, meaning that an entire Chinook salmon generation has been subjected to poor ocean productivity conditions (Figure 129)."

    "section": "5.4 Abundance and productivity",
    "text": "5.4 Abundance and productivity\nUpdated data series on spawner abundance, age structure and hatchery/natural proportions were used to generate current assessments of abundance and productivity at the population level. Evaluations were done using both a set of metrics similar to those used in prior Biological Review Team (BRT) reviews (see Methods) as well as a set corresponding to the specific viability criteria based on ICTRT recommendations for this ESU. The BRT level metrics were consistently done across all ESUs and DPSs to facilitate comparisons across domains. Assessments using the ICTRT metrics are described in the TRT and Recovery Plan Criteria section below. The ICTRT abundance and productivity metrics are measured over longer time frames to dampen the effects of annual variations and they use annual natural origin age composition to calculate brood year recruitment when sampling levels meet regional fishery agency criteria.\nAnnual spawning escapements for all three of the extant Upper Columbia spring Chinook populations showed steep declines beginning in the late 1980s, leading to extremely low abundance levels in the mid-1990s (Figure 5, Table 2). The steep downward trend reflects the extremely low return rates for natural production from the 1990-94 brood years (Figure 6). Estimated replacement rates were consistently below 1.0 even at low parent spawner levels throughout the 1990s. Steeply declining trends across indices of total spawner abundance were a major consideration in the 1998 BRT risk assessment prior to listing of the ESU. Using the updated data series for this review, the short-term (5 year) trend in wild spawners has been strongly negative for all three extant populations (Table 2). Longer term (15 year) trends are also negative for all three populations, although the 95% confidence intervals in each case include 0 (Table 3). In general, both total and natural origin escapements for all three populations increased sharply from 1999 through 2002 and have shown substantial year to year variations in the years following, with peaks around 2001 and 2010 and declines after 2010. Average natural origin returns remain well below ICTRT minimum threshold levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Smoothed trend in estimated total (thick black line, with 95% confidence internal in gray) and natural (thin red line) population spawning abundance. In portions of a time series where a population has no annual estimates but smoothed spawning abundance is estimated from correlations with other populations the smoothed estimate is shown in light gray. Points show the annual raw spawning abundance estimates. For some trends the smoothed estimate may be influenced by earlier data points not included in the plot.\n\n\n\n\nThe annual natural return per spawner series for each population directly reflects the patterns in natural origin abundance and was only positive during a period of strong population increase Figure 6). Brood year escapements with positive return per spawner values are associated with those years leading up to the peaks in natural origin spawner returns in each series. Using the R/S and SAR indicators by population (Figure 4), it is possible to generate an indicator of fresh water productivity (FWPI) as a ratio of R/S and SAR. This quantity can be thought of as an indicator of smolts per spawner, and thus, the overall population productivity in the freshwater environment. FWPI for Upper Columbia Spring Chinook populations are low (<100, Figure 7), confirming areas of recovery action focus such as pre-spawn mortality and juvenile rearing habitat condition. The initial risk assessment for this ESU (ICTRT 2007) found that achieving natural origin abundance and productivity levels above the threshold viability curve corresponding to 5% risk in extinction will require substantial improvements in survival and/or natural production capacity. The long-term population productivity data indicates that this assessment is still valid.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Trends in population productivity, estimated as the log of the smoothed natural spawning abundance in year t divided by the smoothed natural spawning abundance in year t- 4.

    "text": "5.5 Spatial structure and diversity\nThe proportions of natural origin contributions to spawning in the Wenatchee and Methow populations have trended downwards from 1990 to 2008 (Figure 9, Table 4), reflecting the large increase in releases and subsequent returns from the directed supplementation programs in those two drainages (Hillman et al. 2015). Natural origin fractions increased from 2009 to 2017, reflecting increasing natural origin abundance trends and changes to hatchery management, before declining again in the two years. There is currently no direct spring run hatchery supplementation program in the Entiat River, though the summer run releases do have the potential to impact the spring run through redd superimposition. Prior to 2011, hatchery-origin spawners in the Entiat River system are predominately strays from Entiat NFH releases. The Entiat NFH spring Chinook release program was discontinued in 2007, and the upward trend in proportional natural origin since then can be attributed to that closure. In recent years, hatchery supplementation returns from the adjacent Wenatchee River program have also strayed into the Entiat (Ford et al. 2015). The nearby Eastbank Hatchery facility is used for rearing the Wenatchee River supplementation stock prior to transfer to the Chiwawa acclimation pond. It is possible that some of the returns from that program are homing on the Eastbank facility and then straying into the Entiat River, the nearest spawning area.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Smoothed trend in the estimated fraction of the natural spawning population consisting of fish if natural origin.

    "section": "5.6 Biological viability relative to recovery goals",
    "text": "5.6 Biological viability relative to recovery goals\nNOAA Fisheries (National Marine Fisheries Service adopted a recovery plan for Upper Columbia Spring Chinook and steelhead in 2007 (FR 72 #194. 57303-57307). The Plan was developed by the Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Board (UCSRB) and is available through their website (http://www.ucsrb.com/). The Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Plan’s overall goal is “...to achieve recovery and delisting of spring Chinook salmon and steelhead by ensuring the long-term persistence of viable populations of naturally produced fish distributed across their native range.”\nTwo incremental levels of recovery objectives are incorporated into the Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Plan. Increasing natural production sufficiently to upgrade each Upper Columbia River ESU from “endangered” to “threatened” status is stated as an initial objective. The Plan includes three specific quantitative reclassification criteria expressed relative to population viability curves (ICTRT 2007a). Abundance and productivity of natural origin spring Chinook salmon within each of the extant Upper Columbia populations, measured as 8-year geometric means (representing approximately two generations), must fall above the viability curve representing the minimum combinations projecting to a 10% risk of extinction over 100 years. In addition, the plan incorporates explicit criteria for spatial structure and diversity adopted from the ICTRT viability report. The mean score for the three metrics representing natural rates and spatially mediated processes should result in a moderate or lower risk in each of the three populations and all threats defined as high risk must be addressed. In addition, the mean score for the eight ICTRT metrics tracking natural levels of variation should result in a moderate or lower risk score at the population level.\nAchieving recovery (delisting) of each ESU via sufficient improvement in the abundance, productivity, spatial structure and diversity is the longer-term goal of the UCSRB Plan. The Plan includes two specific quantitative criteria for assessing the status of the Spring Chinook ESU against the recovery objective; “The 12-year geometric mean (representing approximately three generations) of abundance and productivity of naturally produced spring Chinook within the Wenatchee, Entiat and Methow populations must reach a level that would have not less than a 5% extinction-risk (viability) over a 100 year period” and “at a minimum, the Upper Columbia Spring Chinook ESU will maintain at least 4,500 naturally produced spawners and a spawner:spawner ratio greater than 1:1 distributed among the three populations”. The minimum number of naturally produced spawners (expressed as 12 year geometric means) should exceed 2,000 each for the Wenatchee and Methow River populations and 500 within the Entiat River. Minimum productivity thresholds were also established in the Plan. The 12-year geometric mean productivity should exceed 1.2 spawners per parent spawner for the two larger populations (Wenatchee and Methow Rivers), and 1.4 for the smaller Entiat River population. The ICTRT had recommended that at least two of the three extant populations be targeted for highly viable status (less than 1% risk of extinction over 100 years) because of the relatively low number of extant populations remaining in the ESU. The UC Plan adopted an alternative approach for addressing the limited number of populations in the ESU – 5% or less risk of extinction for all three extant populations.\nThe Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Plan also calls for ’… restoring the distribution of naturally produced spring Chinook salmon and steelhead to previously occupied areas where practical; and conserving their genetic and phenotypic diversity.” Specific criteria included in the UCSRB Plan reflect a combination of the specific criteria recommended by the ICTRT (ICTRT 2007) and in the earlier QAR effort (Ford et al. 2001). The Plan incorporates spatial structure criteria specific to each spring Chinook salmon population. For the Wenatchee River population, the criteria call for observed natural spawning in four of the five major spawning areas as well as in at least one of the minor spawning areas downstream of Tumwater Dam. In the Methow River, natural spawning should be observed in three major spawning areas. In each case, the major spawning areas should include a minimum of 5% of the total return to the system or 20 redds, whichever is greater. The Entiat River Spring Chinook population includes a single historical major spawning area.\n\nTable . 15-year trends in log wild spawner abundance computed from a linear regression applied to the smoothed wild spawner log abundance estimate.

The 10-year geometric mean abundance of adult natural-origin spawners has not changed by more than 25% relative to the levels reported in the 2015 status update. Natural origin escapements still remains well below the corresponding ICTRT thresholds for all populations. The combinations of current abundance and productivity for each population result in a high risk rating when compared to the ICTRT viability curves.\nThe composite spatial structure/diversity (SS/D) risks for all three of the extant populations in this MPG are rated at high (Table 5). The spatial processes component of the SS/D risk is low for the Wenatchee and Methow river populations and moderate for the Entiat River (due to a loss of production in lower section which increases effective distance to other populations). All three of the extant populations in this MPG are rated at high risk for diversity, driven primarily by chronically high proportions of hatchery-origin spawners in natural spawning areas and lack of genetic diversity among the natural-origin spawners (ICTRT 2007).\nBased on the combined ratings for A/P and SS/D, all three of the extant populations of Upper Columbia spring Chinook salmon remain rated at high overall risk (Table 5)."

Productivities also continued to be very low and both abundance and productivity remained well below the viable thresholds called for in the Upper Columbia Recovery Plan for all three populations. Short-term patterns in those indicators appear to be largely driven by year-to year fluctuations in survival rates in areas outside of these watersheds, in particular a recent run of poor ocean condition years. All three populations continued to be rated at low risk for spatial structure but at high risk for diversity criteria. Large-scale supplementation efforts in the Methow and Wenatchee Rivers are ongoing, intended to counter short-term demographic risks given current average survival levels and the associated year-to-year variability. Under the current recovery plan, habitat protection and restoration actions are being implemented that are directed at key limiting factors.\nGiven the high degree of year-to-year variability in life stage survivals and the time lags resulting from the 5-year life cycle of the populations, it is not possible to detect incremental gains from habitat actions implemented to date in population level measures of adult abundance or productivity. Efforts are underway to develop life stage specific estimates of performance (survival and capacities) and to use a life cycle model framework to evaluate progress (Zabel & Jordan 2020, chapter 6). Based on the information available for this review, the risk category for the Upper Columbia Spring Chinook ESU remains unchanged from the prior review (NWFSC 2015). Although the viability of the ESU remains improved relative to measures available at the time of listing, all three populations remain at high risk."

    "text": "6.2 Summary of previous viability conclusions\n2005\nThe 2005 BRT report evaluated the viability of Snake River spring/summer Chinook using data on returns through 2001, with the majority of BRT risk rating points being assigned to the most likely to be endangered category (Good et al. 2005). The BRT noted that although there were a number of extant spawning aggregations within this ESU, a substantial number of historical spawning populations have been lost. The most serious risk factor for the ESU was low natural productivity (spawner to spawner return rates) and the associated decline in abundance to extremely low levels relative to historical returns. Large increases in escapement estimates for many (but not all) areas for the 2001 return year were considered encouraging by the BRT. However the BRT also acknowledged that return levels were highly variable and that abundance should be measured over at least an 8 year period and that by this measure the then recent abundance levels across the ESU fall short of interim objectives. The BRT was concerned about the high level of production/mitigation and supplementation hatchery programs across the ESU, noting that these programs represented ongoing risks to natural populations and made it difficult to assess trends in natural productivity and growth rates. The phasing out of the non-native Rapid River-origin hatchery program in the Grande Ronde Basin was viewed as a positive action.\n2010\nFord et al. (2011) concluded that population level viability ratings remained at high risk across all MPGs within the ESU; although natural spawning abundance estimates had increased, all populations remained below minimum natural origin abundance thresholds. Relatively low natural production rates and spawning levels below minimum abundance thresholds remained a major concern across the ESU. The ability of populations to be self-sustaining through normal periods of relatively low ocean survival remained uncertain. Factors cited by the 2005 BRT (Good et al. 2005) remained as concerns or key uncertainties for several populations. Overall, the new information considered in 2010 did not indicate a change in the biological risk category since the time of the prior BRT status review in 2005.\n2015\nNWFSC (2015) concluded that the majority of populations in the Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon ESU remained at high overall risk. Natural origin abundance had increased over the levels reported in the prior review for most populations in this ESU, although the increases were not substantial enough to change viability ratings. Relatively high ocean survivals in recent years were a major factor in recent abundance patterns. Ten populations increased in both abundance and productivity, seven increased in abundance while their updated productivity estimates decreased, two populations decreased in abundance and increased in productivity. Spatial structure ratings remain unchanged from the prior reviews, with low or moderate risk levels for the majority of populations in the ESU."

    "text": "6.3 Description of new data available for this review\nThe previous ESA status review (NWFSC 2015) analyzed spawner abundance data series for most populations in this ESU using expansions from index area redd counts and weir estimates (ICTRT 2010). The current ICTRT data series extends the time period of record through at least the 2018 or 2019 return year for populations across all of the MPGs in the Spring/Summer Chinook ESU. Data and analyses used in this assessment were obtained primarily from state and tribal fisheries agencies. ODFW, WDFW and IDFG updated annual estimates of spawning escapement, hatchery/wild spawner fractions and age composition for most populations, often incorporating data generated by regional projects conducted by the Nez Perce, Umatilla and Shoshone Bannock tribal fisheries departments. In several cases the primary source for information on a population was an ongoing tribal sampling program (e.g., the Didson sonar based program in the Secesh River and the mark recapture weir sampling project in Johnson Creek – both conducted by the Nez Perce Tribal Fisheries department). A major advance since the data compilation efforts leading to the 2015 ESA status review has been the cooperative efforts of regional fish managers to maintain regionally compatible databases using standardized formats and methods to promote efficiency and access to population level estimates of key viability indicators including spawning abundance, hatchery/natural proportions and age structure through the Coordinated Assessments Program.\nEfforts to refine and document the estimates for individual populations have continued. In most cases, updates to estimated escapements or hatchery/wild spawner proportions for prior years have been relatively minor. Notable additions and changes include incorporation of additional spawner survey and weir count data provided by the Shoshone -Bannock Tribal Fisheries Department into population level spawner estimates for the Yankee Fork and Panther Creek.\nPIT tag detection based population abundance estimates for populations above Lower Granite Dam have been generated for return years 2010-2019 based on a state-space patch occupancy model (DABOM) that partitions the natural origin run at large passing Lower Granite Dam into 28 population groups (Kinzer et al. 2020). By combining PBT based identification of phenotypically unmarked hatchery origin fish, PIT tag based escapement data can be used to more robustly estimate natural origin population abundance. This approach adds valuable information to the robust population estimation process that has been in place for decades based on redd and weir counts. For example, by incorporating data from sex markers and scale ageing, estimates of sex ratio (Figure 6.2) and age structure can be made for each of the patches in the population estimation model\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Natural origin spring/summer Chinook female proportion (95% confidence intervals shown in grey) by year and population (grouped by MPG) as estimated from the state space patch occupancy model, DABOM. Note that the figure includes non-listed population groups from the Clearwater River basin, reproduced directly from IPTDSW 2020.\n\n\n\n\nPopulation genetic structure\nSampling of adult Snake River spring/summer Chinook at Lower Granite Dam and subsequent detections of PIT tags in ICTRT population spawning areas has allowed the development of a large genetic data set based on SNP markers (Kinzer et al. 2020). A neighbor-joining tree (Figure 6.3) created from PIT tagged adults over the spawning years 2010-2019, when combined with reference GSI baseline samples across the ESU,confirms most of the expected population structure, with the notable exception of the samples from fish spawning in the Little Salmon River grouping genetically with the Upper South Fork Clearwater samples (Kinzer et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: A neighbor-joining tree for Snake River Chinook Salmon populations included in the GSI baseline version 3.1 and collections of PIT tagged returning adults for SY2010-2019 based on Cavalii-Sforza Edwards chord distance. Bootstrap support greater than 70% based on 1,000 replicated are reported. Figure reproduced from Kinzer et al. 2020.\n\n\n\n\nSpatial structure\nICTRT criteria for evaluating spatial structure within populations are based on observing evidence of spawning usage across defined spawning areas within populations, with an emphasis on historically relatively large contiguous reaches (major and minor spawning areas). Redd surveys were conducted by co-managers (NPT, SBT, ODFW, WDFW, IDFG) and the geolocated redds were aligned with ICTRT identified major and minor spawning area over the 2015-2019 run years (Felts et al. 2020). Monitoring occurred in 29 major spawning areas, 13 of which were rated as occupied, while monitoring of eight minor spawning areas resulted in only one being rated as occupied. However, non-occupied ratings of mSA and MSA does not equate to only no spawning as a “unoccupied” rating can also result from patchy spawning not distributed across the entire reach.\nOcean Condition Indices\nSnake River spring/summer Chinook salmon are a component of the Columbia River run that is believed to occupy mid-shelf waters during the early ocean life history phase. Aggregate annual returns of Columbia River Spring Chinook are correlated with a range of ocean condition indices including measures of broad scale physical conditions, local biological indicators, and local physical factors (Figure 129) (Peterson et al. 2014a). Several indicators, either individually or in combination, correlate well with spring Chinook salmon adult returns with a lag of 1 to 2 years. However, for each specific indicator or combination, there are anomalous years that fall outside of the apparent relationships. Work is continuing to further understand the relationships among physical and biological ‘drivers’ and annual levels of ocean survival for salmonid species in the ocean environment. After accounting for age at return at time of ocean entry, the annual pattern in the Snake River spring/summer Chinook ESU SAR index generally corresponds to the composite rankings across ocean indicators available for early ocean years starting in the late 1990s (Peterson et al. 2014). Indicators of ocean condition are highly correlated with each other, and exhibit strong temporal autocorrelation (Figure 129, Peterson et al. (2019)). As a result, when indicators point to conditions that result in poor ocean productivity for salmonid populations, they do so as a suite of indicators, and for runs of ‘good’ or ‘bad’ years (see Habitat chapter). Historically, ocean conditions cycled between periods of high and low productivity. However, global climate change is likely to disrupt this pattern, in general, leading to a preponderance of low productivity years, with an unknown temporal distribution (Crozier et al. 2020). Recent (2015-2019) ensemble ocean indicators rankings include four of the worst seven years in the past 20, meaning that an entire Chinook generation has been subjected to poor ocean productivity conditions."

    "text": "6.4 Abundance and productivity\nUpdated data series on spawner abundance, age structure and hatchery/natural proportions were used to generate current assessments of abundance and productivity at the population level. Evaluations were done using both a set of metrics corresponding to those used in prior ESA status reviews as well as a set corresponding to the specific viability criteria based on ICTRT recommendations for this ESU. The viability review metrics were done consistently across all ESUs and DPSs to facilitate comparisons across domains. Assessments using the ICTRT metrics are described in the TRT and Recovery Plan Criteria section below. The ICTRT abundance and productivity metrics are measured over longer time frames to dampen the effects of annual variations and they use annual natural origin age composition to calculate brood year recruitment when sampling levels meet agency criteria.\nEstimates of the annual abundance of natural origin spawners within each of 27 Snake River Spring Summer Chinook ESU populations are summarized in five year increments (Table 6.1) and are illustrated in Figure 6.4. The most recent five year geometric mean abundance estimates for 26 out of the 27 populations are lower than the corresponding estimates for the previous five year period by varying degrees, the estimate for the 27th population was a slight increase from a very low abundance in the prior five year period. The entire ESU abundance data shows a consistent and marked pattern of declining population size, with the recent five year abundance levels for the 27 populations declining by an average of 55%. Medium-term (15 year) population trends in total spawner abundance were positive over the period 1990 to 2005 for all of the population natural origin abundance series, and are all declining over the more recent time interval (2004-2019; Table 6.2, Figure 6.4). The consistent and sharp declines for all populations in the ESU are concerning as the abundances for some populations are approaching similar levels to those of the early 1990s when the ESU was listed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Smoothed trend in estimated total (thick black line, with 95% confidence internal in gray) and natural (thin red line) population spawning abundance. In portions of a time series where a population has no annual estimates but smoothed spawning abundance is estimated from correlations with other populations the smoothed estimate is shown in light gray. Points show the annual raw spawning abundance estimates. For some trends the smoothed estimate may be influenced by earlier data points not included in the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Trends in population productivity, estimated as the log of the smoothed natural spawning abundance in year t divided by the smoothed natural spawning abundance in year t- 4.

In parentheses, 5-year geometric mean of raw total spawner counts is shown. A value only in parentheses means that a total spawner count was available but no or only one estimate of natural spawners available. The geometric mean was computed as the product of counts raised to the power 1 over the number of counts available (2 to 5). A minimum of 2 values were used to compute the geometric mean.

The SAR indices represent cumulative marine, nearshore and estuary survival. shows the geometric mean of R/S and SAR indices for the stocks available across five MPGs in the ESU. In general, these broad-brush descriptors of population processes indicate relatively poor ocean survival for the Salmon River MPGs and relatively poor freshwater productivity for the Grande Ronde and Lower Snake River MPGs. Using the R/S and SAR indicators by population, it is possible to generate an indicator of fresh water productivity (FWPI) as a ratio of R/S and SAR. This quantity can be thought of as an indicator of smolts per spawner, and thus, the overall population productivity in the freshwater environment. An FWPI score of >100 should indicate healthy fresh water productivity (roughly 100 smolts per female). The initial assessment by the ICTRT (2007) identified significant abundance/productivity gaps for this ESU. In general, populations within Grande Ronde and Lower Snake River MPG are still showing the lowest productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Smolt to Adult Return, Recruits per Spawner, and Freshwater Productivity Index (FWPI) for each of the populations in the ESU. Geometric means of SAR and R/S are shown for each population, along with the standard error of the estimate (whiskers represent +/- one standard error). The time period included in the SAR or R/S indices is the past 20 years, depending on data availability. The FWPI is constructed as a ratio of the geomean R/S and SAR, and can be thought of as a measure of smolts per spawner."

In some years additional harvest in the Snake River basin on specific populations within the ESU occurs. Snake River summer Chinook share the ocean distribution patterns of the upper basin spring runs and are only subject to significant harvest in the mainstem Columbia River. Harvest of summer Chinook has been more constrained than that of spring Chinook with consequently lower exploitation rates on the summer component of this ESU. However, the overall pattern of exploitation rates calculated by the TAC is nearly identical to that of the Upper Columbia River spring Chinook.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Non-treaty exploitation rates for Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon in the mainstem Columbia River fisheries.

    "section": "6.6 Spatial structure and diversity",
    "text": "6.6 Spatial structure and diversity\nCurrent estimates of spatial structure and diversity ratings for Snake River Spring/Summer Chinook populations are summarized in Table 14. The ICTRT ratings for spatial structure remain unchanged. Most population abundance estimates are based on redd or weir counts conducted across reaches within or across major spawning areas. Recent survey results are consistent with records for the years analyzed by the ICTRT.\nThe proportion of hatchery origin spawners within populations varies considerably across MPGs (Figure 6.8, Table 6.3). All five extant populations in the Grande Ronde River basin had relatively high hatchery spawner proportions in the 1990s, reflecting the large scale use of out of basin stock (Rapid River) in local releases during that period. Managers transitioned the release programs to incorporate local natural origin brood stock in the mid 1990s. Currently five of the six extant natural population tributaries as well as Lookingglass Creek (with an extripated natal population) have targeted hatchery releases. During that transition, returning hatchery origin fish from the Rapid River releases were actively removed prior to spawning. Returns from natural origin broodstock increased as the specific in-basin programs reached their smolt production objectives. The current local broodstock based hatchery programs in three of the basins are designed to supplement natural spawning while contributing to meeting mitigation objectives. Releases into Lookingglass Creek, an extirpated population, are a conventional segregated program. The historical Lookingglass Creek run is believed to have been extirpated as a result of the out of basin hatchery program. The current program uses broodstock that originated from Catherine Creek. The Minam and Wenaha River populations do not have direct supplementation programs. The Imnaha River, an adjacent river basin to the Grande Ronde, is also in this MPG, has an ongoing integrated hatchery program that incorporates natural origin broodstock.\nThe single current extant population in the Lower Snake River MPG, the Tucannon River, has an ongoing supplementation program, and hatchery returns have constituted about a third of spawning in natural areas in recent years. Mark recapture estimates compared to redd count and carcass recoveries indicate that prespawn mortalities in the Tucannon River have been relatively high in recent years. Efforts are underway to further quantify and to identify potential direct causes (Bumgarner and Dedloff 2015). Hatchery proportions for populations in the Middle Fork Salmon MPG are based on carcass recoveries and remain very low, indicating negligible straying rates as there are no direct release programs in this river basin.\nThree of the four South Fork Salmon MPG populations have ongoing hatchery programs. Hatchery proportions for the two of the three populations in the South Fork Salmon River with active hatchery programs decreased marginally in the most recent five year update. The Secesh River continues to show low hatchery proportions reflecting some straying from the programs in the adjacent populations. Integrated hatchery programs are now being implemented in parallel to ongoing production (segregated) operations in the South Fork and East Fork of the South Fork Salmon River facilities. The ICTRT included a fourth population in the neighboring Little Salmon River drainage in this MPG. This population includes returns from large scale hatchery releases although some of its side tributary spawning areas likely have low hatchery contributions. Direct estimates of natural origin spawners for this population are limited to weir passage counts for the Rapid River tributary.\nIn the Upper Salmon River MPG, four of the seven populations with sufficient information to directly estimate hatchery contributions had very low hatchery proportions (Lemhi River, East Fork Salmon River, Valley Creek and the Lower Mainstem Salmon River). The most recent five year mean for the Pahsimeroi River was also relatively low. Both of the hatchery facilities in this MPG are operating parallel integrated and segregated programs. Two of the other populations in this MPG are the subject of active hatchery release programs as reflected in their respective average spawner proportions. Hatchery contributions to spawning in the bulk of the habitat used by the Upper Salmon River population are regulated by managing passage at Sawtooth weir, located on the mainstem Salmon River near the downstream extent of spawning. Releases of any origin fish (integrated/segregated) has occurred above the weirs at both the USR and PAH facilities to meet escapement goals due to recent low returns. Clearly, pHOS in these populations will be impacted, but operating agreement balances the risks associated with introgression with depensation at very low run sizes. Hatchery proportions within the Yankee Fork population have increased substantially in recent years, reflecting returns from a large scale supplementation effort conducted by the Shosonne Bannock tribal fisheries department. In some recent years the program has augmented ongoing smolt releases with adult plants in the Yankee Fork and egg boxes in Panther Creek, when there are surplus returns from the Sawtooth Hatchery program in the Upper Salmon River Denny and Blackadar (2015).

    "text": "6.7 Biological viability relative to recovery goals\nThe ICTRT identified 27 extant and 4 extirpated populations of Snake River Spring/Summer Chinook salmon that historically used the accessible tributary and upper mainstem habitats within the Snake River drainages (ICTRT 2003). The populations are aggregated into five extant Major Population Groupings (MPGs) based on genetic, environmental and life history characteristics. The Lower Snake River MPG includes the Tucannon River and Asotin Creek (extirpated) populations. The Grande Ronde/Imnaha River MPG includes six populations within the Grande Ronde River drainage and two in the Imnaha River. Three populations within the South Fork Salmon River drainage and a fourth in the Little Salmon River form an additional MPG. Chamberlain Creek along with six populations in the Middle Fork drainage constitute the next upstream MPG. The Upper Salmon River MPG includes several major tributary populations along with two mainstem sections also classified as independent populations. In 2017 NOAA Fisheries completed a recovery plan for Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon and Snake River Basin steelhead {NMFS, 2017 #2520}.\nRecovery Plan Criteria\nThe recovery criteria are hierarchical in nature, with ESU/DPS level criteria being based on the viability of natural origin Chinook salmon assessed at the population level. The population level assessments are based on a set of metrics designed to evaluate risk across the four viable salmonid population (VSP) elements – abundance, productivity, spatial structure and diversity (McElhany et al. 2000). The Recovery Plans adopt the ICTRT approach for comparing estimates of current natural origin abundance (measured as a 10 year geometric mean of natural origin spawners) and productivity (estimate of return per spawner at low to moderate parent spawning abundance) against predefined viability curves. The Recovery Plan also applies the ICTRT criteria (metrics and example risk thresholds) for assessing the spatial structure and diversity risks based on current information representing each specific population.\nThe ICTRT recommended that each extant MPG should include viable populations totaling at least half of the populations historically present, with all major life history groups represented. In addition, the viable populations within an MPG should include proportional representation of large and very large populations historically present. The Recovery Plan uses the MPG scenarios and also suggests that at least one population in a viable MPG should meet criteria for Highly Viable. Within any particular MPG, there may be several specific combinations of populations that could satisfy these criteria. The Recovery Plan outlines example scenarios that would satisfy the criteria for all extant MPGs. In each case the remaining populations in an MPG should be at or above maintained status.\nLower Snake River MPG: This MPG historically contained two populations, and one, Asotin Creek, is currently considered extirpated. The Recovery Plan basic criteria would call for both populations being restored to viable status. The Recovery Plan recommends the priority of restoring the Tucannon River to highly viable status, and then evaluating the potential for reintroducing production in Asotin Creek as recovery progresses.\nGrande Ronde MPG: This MGP had eight historical populations, two of which are currently considered functionally extirpated. The basic Recovery Plan criteria call for a minimum of 4 populations at viable or highly viable status. The potential scenario would include viable populations in the Imnaha River (run timing), the Lostine/Wallowa River (large size) and at least one from each of the following pairs: Catherine Creek or Upper Grande Ronde (large size populations); and Minam River or Wenaha River.\nSouth Fork MPG: Two of the four historical populations in this MPG should be restored to viable or highly viable status. The Recovery Plan recommends that the populations in the South Fork drainages should be given priority relative to meeting MPG viability objectives given the relatively small size and the high level of potential hatchery integration for the Little Salmon River population.\nMiddle Fork MPG: The Recovery Plan criteria call for at least five of the nine populations in this MPG to be rated as viable, with at least one demonstrating highly viable status. The base example recovery scenario includes Chamberlain Creek (geographic position), Big Creek (large size category), Bear Valley Creek, Marsh Creek, and either Loon Creek or Camas Creek.\nUpper Salmon MPG: This MPG included nine historical populations one of which, Panther Creek, is considered functionally extirpated. The base example recovery scenario for this MPG includes the Pahsimeroi River (summer Chinook life history); the Lemhi River and Upper Salmon Mainstem (very large size category); East Fork Salmon River (large size category) and Valley Creek. The continued, and building presence of a spawning population in Panther Creek argues for its role in recovery scenarios to be reconsidered.\nTable 14. Snake River spring/summer Chinook populations. Summary of status relative to the ICTRT viability criteria, grouped by MPG. Natural spawning abundance: most recent 10 year geometric mean (range). ICTRT productivity: 20 year geometric mean for parent escapements below 75% of population threshold. Current abundance and productivity estimates are geometric means.

    "text": "6.8 Updated biological risk summary\nThe majority of populations in the Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon ESU remained at high overall risk, with three populations (Minam, Bear Valley and Marsh Creek) improving to an overall rating of maintained due to an increase in abundance/productivity when measured over a 10-20 year period (Table 14). However, natural origin abundance has generally decreased over the levels reported in the prior review for most populations in this ESU, in many cases sharply. Relatively low ocean survivals in recent years were likely a major factor in recent abundance patterns. All but three populations in this ESU remained at high risk for abundance and productivity.\nSpatial structure ratings remain unchanged from the prior reviews, with low or moderate risk levels for the majority of populations in the ESU. Four populations from three MPGs (Catherine Creek and Upper Grande Ronde, Lemhi River and Lower Middle Fork Mainstem) remain at high risk for spatial structure loss. Three of the four extant MPGs in this ESU have populations that are undergoing active supplementation with local broodstock hatchery programs. In most cases those programs evolved from mitigation efforts and include some form of sliding scale management guidelines designed to maximize potential benefits in low abundance years and reduce potential negative impacts at higher spawning levels. Efforts to evaluate key assumptions and impacts are underway for several programs, but it appears likely that these programs reduce risk of extinction in the short term.\nIn summary, while there have been improvements in abundance/productivity in several populations relative to the time of listing, the majority of populations experienced sharp declines in abundance in the recent 5-year period, primarily due to variation in ocean survival. If ocean survival rates remain low, the ESU’s viability will clearly become much more tenuous, although if survivals improve in the near term it is likely the populations could rebound quickly. Overall, at this time we conclude that this ESU continues to be at moderate-to-high risk.\n\n\n\n\nBumgarner, J. D., and J. Dedloff. 2015.
