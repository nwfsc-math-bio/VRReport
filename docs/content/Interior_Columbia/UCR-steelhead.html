<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="brief-description-of-dps"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Brief description of DPS</h2>
<p>The Upper Columbia Steelhead DPS includes all naturally spawned anadromous <em>O. mykiss</em> (steelhead) populations below natural and manmade impassable barriers in streams in the Columbia River Basin upstream from the Yakima River, Washington, to the US-Canada border, as well as six artificial propagation programs (85 FR 81822 and Figure 10). The Upper Columbia Steelhead DPS was originally listed under the ESA in 1997; it is currently designated as threatened.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Figure . Map of the Upper steelhead DPS’s spawning and rearing areas, illustrating populations and major population groups.</p>
<p>NOAA Fisheries has defined DPSs of steelhead to include only the anadromous members of this species (70 FR 67130). Our approach to assessing the current viability of a steelhead DPS is based on evaluating information on the abundance, productivity, spatial structure and diversity of the anadromous component of the species (Good <em>et al</em>. 2005; 85 FR 81822). Many steelhead populations along the West Coast of the U.S. co-occur with conspecific populations of resident rainbow trout. We recognize that there may be situations where reproductive contributions from resident rainbow trout may mitigate short-term extinction risk for some steelhead DPSs (Good <em>et al.</em> 2005); 85 FR 81822). We assume that any benefits to an anadromous population resulting from the presence of a conspecific resident form will be reflected in direct measures of the current viability of the anadromous form.</p>

<p><em>2005</em></p>
<p>The 2005 BRT cited low growth rate/productivity as the most serious risk factor for the Upper Columbia River steelhead DPS (Good <em>et al.</em> 2005). In particular, the BRT concluded that the extremely low replacement rate of natural spawners highlighted in the 1998 review continued through the subsequent brood cycle. The 2005 BRT assessment also identified very low natural spawner abundance compared to interim escapement objectives and high levels of hatchery spawners in natural areas as contributing risk factors. The 2005 BRT report did note that the number of naturally produced steelhead returning to spawn within this DPS had increased over the levels reported in the 1998 status review. As with the Mid-Columbia and Snake River DPS reviews, the 2005 BRT recognized that resident <em>O. mykiss</em> were associated with anadromous steelhead production areas for this DPS. The review stated that the presence of resident <em>O. mykiss</em> was considered a mitigating factor by many of the BRT members in rating extinction risk.</p>
<p><em>2010</em></p>
<p>The 2010 status review update reported that Upper Columbia steelhead populations had increased in natural origin abundance in recent years, but productivity levels remained low (Ford <em>et al.</em> 2011). The proportions of hatchery origin returns in natural spawning areas remained extremely high across the DPS, especially in the Methow and Okanogan River populations. The modest improvements in natural returns that had been observed the years prior to the review were probably primarily the result of several years of relatively good natural survival in the ocean and tributary habitats. Tributary habitat actions called for in the Upper Columbia Recovery Plan were anticipated to be implemented over the next 25 years and the benefits of some of those actions would require some time to be realized. Overall, the new information considered did not indicate a change in the biological risk category since the time of the last BRT status review.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>2015</em></p>
<p>Based on the review in 2015, Upper Columbia River steelhead populations were determined to have increased relative to the low levels observed in the 1990s, but natural origin abundance and productivity remained well below viability thresholds for three out of the four populations (NWFSC 2015). The viability of the Wenatchee River steelhead population continued to improve based on the additional years information available for this review. The abundance and productivity viability rating for the Wenatchee River exceeds the minimum threshold for 5% extinction risk. However, the overall DPS viability remains unchanged from the prior review, remaining at high risk driven by low abundance and productivity relative to viability objectives and diversity concerns. Application of the criteria for abundance/productivity results in relatively coarse scale ratings for each population. Across Interior Columbia DPSs, the populations differ in the relative changes in survival or limiting capacities that could lead to viable ratings. The required improvement to improve the abundance/productivity estimates for Upper Columbia Steelhead populations is at the high end of the range for all listed Interior populations.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="description-of-new-data-available-for-this-review"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Description of new data available for this review</h2>
<p>The 2015 NWFSC status review (NWFSC 2015) evaluated the viability of the Upper Columbia Steelhead DPS based on data series through cycle year 2013/2014 for each of the four extant populations, along with sampling information collected at Priest Rapids Dam for the aggregate return to the Upper Columbia Basin and Wells Dam (Methow and Okanogan populations combined). Estimates generated using that methodology are currently available through the 2018/2019 cycle years for each population. Spawning escapement estimates are based on a run reconstruction model incorporating annual dam counts, results of a three year radio tracking program and estimates of broodstock and fisheries removals in various reaches above Rock Island Dam. Estimates are generated by WDFW regional staff (incorporating information from the Colville Tribal Fish &amp; Wildlife Department) and are available through the StreamNet Coordinated Assessment Project website. An updated approach for estimating population level escapements has been initiated in recent years. That approach uses mark/recapture statistics based on data generated from the combination of systematic PIT tagging of a target proportion of the returns passing Rock Island Dam (below all four population spawning tributaries) and subsequent detections at arrays in each of the tributaries (Waterhouse <em>et al.</em> 2020). Comparisons of the results from the updated approach with the methods used in prior years indicate they generally produce compatible estimates for a given year. Preliminary results are included in this assessment, in parallel to the ongoing data collection based population assessments, with the understanding that ongoing methodological and data evaluations will result in a single approach to annual population enumeration in the future.</p>
<p><em>Smolt to Adult Return and Recruits per Spawner Rates</em></p>
<p>Smolt to Adult Return (SAR) estimates (Bonneville to Bonneville) for all four Upper Columbia River Steelhead population data series are generated by the Columbia River Data Access in Real Time (CBR, 2020) project using PIT tag detections from all release locations within each population basin (Columbia River DART, 2020). The indices represent cumulative marine, nearshore and estuary survival. The SAR series includes estimates for the range of brood years 2002-2015 (Figure 11). Over the period of record, the geometric mean SAR for the Entiat, Methow and Okanogan populations (~3%) represents a low, but reasonable marine survival (2% is generally considered a minimal replacement rate), with the Wenatchee SAR of ~5% being a robust rate for a stable population. Recruits per Spawner (R/S) indices are reported as available from the StreamNet Coordinated Assessments data portal (StreamNet, 2020a). All populations in the ESU have low (&lt; 1.0) R/S values, implying that the natural replacement rate is not keeping up with all sources of mortality across the life-cycle. <img src="./media/media/image15.png" style="width:4.15116in;height:2.60465in"></p>
<p>Figure . Smolt to Adult Return and Recruits per Spawner for each of the populations in the ESU. Geometric means of SAR and R/S are shown for each population, along with the standard error of the estimate (whiskers represent +/- one standard error). The time period included in the SAR or R/S indices is the past 20 years, depending on data availability.</p>
<p><em>Ocean Condition Indices</em></p>
<p>Juvenile steelhead are more pelagic than salmon, heading off the continental shelf soon after entering the ocean in the spring (Burgner 1992). Steelhead migrate seasonally across the North Pacific Ocean, moving to the north and west in spring and to the south and east, across the entire Pacific, from autumn through winter (Atcheson <em>et al.</em> 2012). Thus, steelhead ocean survival may be impacted by different factors than salmon. In fact, recent work has shown steelhead population groupings from geographic regions have unique smolt survival trends that appear to be driven by factors affecting them early in their ocean residence despite steelhead smolts generally being larger than Pacific salmon smolts when they enter the ocean and all making wide-ranging, off the continental shelf migrations, rather than remaining more coastal, as Pacific salmon smolts tend to do (Kendall <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>
<p>Aggregate annual returns of Columbia River steelhead are correlated with a range of ocean condition indices including measures of broad scale physical conditions, local biological indicators, and local physical factors (Peterson <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Work is ongoing to relate indices of ocean condition to steelhead populations up and down the West Coast. Steelhead marine survival seems to be related to ocean surface temperature in the first summer of ocean entry, and populations respond similarly to spatial patterns of ocean conditions at a rough grain of 250km between ocean entry points (Kendall <em>et al.</em> 2017). Therefore, broad spatial patterns of ocean conditions may not capture the finer spatial scale of response that steelhead seem to exhibit.</p>
<p>Indicators of ocean condition are highly correlated with each other, and exhibit strong temporal autocorrelation (Figure 129, (Peterson <em>et al.</em> 2019)). As a result, when indicators point to conditions that result in poor ocean productivity for salmonid populations, they do so as a suite of indicators, and for runs of ‘good’ or ‘bad’ years (see Habitat chapter). Historically, ocean conditions cycled between periods of high and low productivity. However, global climate change is likely to disrupt this pattern, in general, leading to a preponderance of low productivity years, with an unknown temporal distribution (Crozier <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Recent (2015-2019) ensemble ocean indicators rankings include four of the worst seven years in the past 20, meaning that an entire salmon or steelhead generation could have been subjected to poor ocean productivity conditions.</p>

<section id="abundance-and-productivity" class="level2" data-number="4.4">
<h2 data-number="4.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abundance-and-productivity"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Abundance and productivity</h2>
<p>Updated data series on spawner abundance, age structure and hatchery wild proportions were used to generate current assessments of abundance and productivity at the population level. Evaluations were done using both a set of metrics corresponding to those used in prior ESA Status Reviews as well as a set corresponding to the specific viability criteria based on ICTRT recommendations for this DPS. The standard Status Review metrics were consistently done across all ESUs and DPSs to facilitate comparisons across domains. Assessments using the ICTRT metrics are described in the TRT and Recovery Plan Criteria section below. The ICTRT abundance and productivity metrics are measured over longer time frames to dampen the effects of annual variations and they use annual natural origin age composition to calculate brood year recruitment when sampling levels meet regional fishery agency criteria.</p>
<p>The most recent estimates (5-year geometric mean) of total and natural-origin spawner abundance have declined dramatically, erasing gains observed over the past two decades for all four populations (Figure 12, Table 6). Recent declines are persistent and large enough to result in small, but negative 15-year trends in abundance for all four populations (Table 7). Updated spawner estimation methods show a strong concordance with existing methods (Figure 13), which is extremely encouraging as the estimation process based on detecting tags from a run-at-large tagging program is a very robust approach to monitoring across the DPS. Annual brood year return-per-spawner estimates have been well below replacement in recent years for all four populations. The return per spawner estimates summarized in Figure 14 are ratios of the estimated natural origin returns produced from spawners in each brood year, under the assumption that both hatchery and natural origin fish contribute to production as parent spawners. All populations are consistently exhibiting natural production rates well below replacement, and natural production has also declined consistently, resulting in an increasing fraction of hatchery fish on the spawning grounds each year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The required improvement to increase abundance and productivity for Upper Columbia Steelhead populations is at the high end of the range for all listed Interior populations. Using the R/S and SAR indicators by population (Figure 15), it is possible to generate an indicator of fresh water productivity (FWPI) as a ratio of R/S and SAR. This quantity can be thought of as an indicator of smolts per spawner, and thus, the overall population productivity in the freshwater environment. FWPI for Upper Columbia steelhead populations are very low (&lt;&lt;100, Figure 15), confirming areas of recovery action focus such as pre-spawn mortality and juvenile rearing habitat condition, as well as mainstem migratory impacts as the SAR are based on Bonneville to Bonneville tag detections and the R/S are based on spawning ground recruits. The initial ICTRT assessment of abundance/productivity gaps resulted in a pattern similar to that indicated by the long-term productivity metrics (ICTRT 2007,). The Wenatchee River population has somewhat higher productivity (SAR, R/S, and FWPI) than the remaining populations in the DPS, but still falls into a high risk category due to the recent downward trend in both abundance and productivity.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Okanogan population, the upper Columbia River populations were rated as low risk for spatial structure. The high risk ratings for diversity are largely driven by high levels of hatchery spawners within natural spawning areas and lack of genetic diversity among the populations. The basic major life history patterns (summer A-run type, tributary and mainstem spawning/rearing patterns, and the presence of resident populations and subpopulations) appear to be present. All of the populations were rated at high risk for current genetic characteristics by the ICTRT. Genetics samples taken in the 1980s indicate little differentiation within populations in the upper Columbia River DPS. More recent studies within the Wenatchee River basin have found differences between samples from the Peshastin River, believed to be relatively isolated from hatchery spawning, and those from other reaches within the Wenatchee. This suggests that there may have been a higher level of within and among population diversity prior to the advent of major hatchery releases (Seamons <em>et al.</em> 2012). Genetic studies based on sampling in the Wenatchee as well as other Upper Columbia River steelhead population tributaries are underway and should allow for future analyses of current genetic structure and any impacts of changing hatchery release practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatchery-origin returns continue to constitute a high fraction of total spawners in natural spawning areas for this DPS (Table 8). The estimated proportion of natural-origin spawners has increased consistently since the late 1990s for all four populations (Figure 16). Natural-origin proportions were the highest in the Wenatchee River (58%). Although increasing, natural origin proportions in the Methow and Okanogan rivers remained at low levels. There are currently direct releases of hatchery origin juveniles in three of the four populations, the exception being the Entiat River. Based on PIT detections, hatchery origin spawners in the Entiat River include stray hatchery returns from releases into the Wenatchee River (Hillman <em>et al.</em> 2015). Reproductive effectiveness studies on the Wenatchee population indicate that hatchery-hatchery matings have dramatically reduced fitness compared to matings among natural-origin fish (Ford <em>et al.</em> 2016), reinforcing the weight the ICTRT placed on the presence of hatchery origin spawners in the Spatial Structure and Diversity metric.</p>

<p>Steelhead were historically taken in tribal and non-tribal gillnet fisheries, and in recreational fisheries in the mainstem Columbia River and in tributaries. In the 1970s, retention of steelhead in non-treaty commercial fisheries was prohibited, and in the mid 1980s, tributary recreational fisheries in Washington adopted mark-selective regulations. There is incidental mortality associated with mark-selective recreational fisheries. Sport fisheries targeting hatchery run steelhead occur in the mainstem Columbia River and in several Upper Columbia River tributaries. In recent years, Upper Columbia River exploitation rates have been stable at around 1.5%. As of 2012, rates are estimated over two management intervals per year, Fall and Winter/Spring/Summer (Figure 17).</p>

<p>NOAA Fisheries adopted a recovery plan for upper Columbia River spring Chinook salmon and steelhead in 2007 (FR 72 #194, 57303−57307). The plan was developed by the Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Board (UCSRB) and is available at: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/recovery-plan-upper-columbia-spring-chinook-salmon-and-steelhead.</p>
<p>Achieving recovery (delisting) of each ESU via sufficient improvement in abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity is the longer term goal of the UC Recovery Plan. The UC Recovery Plan includes specific quantitative criteria expressed relative to population viability curves (ICTRT 2007). It includes two quantitative criteria for assessing the viability of the steelhead DPS against the recovery objective: “The 12-year geometric mean (representing approximately three generations) of abundance and productivity of naturally produced steelhead within the Wenatchee, Entiat, and Methow populations must reach a level that would have not less than a 5% extinction-risk (viability) over a 100 year period” and “at a minimum, the Upper Columbia Steelhead DPS will maintain at least 3,000 naturally produced spawners and a spawner:spawner ratio greater than 1:1 distributed among the three populations.” The minimum number of naturally produced spawners (expressed as 12-year geometric means) should exceed 1,000 each for the Wenatchee and Methow river populations and 500 each for the Entiat and Okanogan river populations. The plan also established minimum productivity thresholds. These natural spawner abundance criteria replace the interim targets referenced in the 2005 BRT report. The 12-year geometric mean productivity should exceed 1.1 spawners per parent spawner for the two larger populations (Wenatchee and Methow Rivers), and 1.2 for the smaller Entiat River and Okanogan populations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ICTRT had recommended that at least two of the four extant populations be targeted for highly viable status (less than 1% risk of extinction over 100 years) because of the relatively low number of extant populations remaining in the DPS. The UC Recovery Plan adopted an alternative approach for addressing the limited number of populations in the DPS—5% or less risk of extinction for at least three of the four extant populations.</p>
<p>The UC Recovery Plan also calls for “… restoring the distribution of naturally produced spring Chinook salmon and steelhead to previously occupied areas where practical, and conserving their genetic and phenotypic diversity.” Specific criteria included in the UC Recovery Plan reflect a combination of the criteria recommended by the ICTRT (ICTRT 2007) and an earlier pre-TRT analytical project (Ford <em>et al.</em> 2001). The plan incorporates spatial structure criteria specific to each steelhead population. For the Wenatchee River population, the criteria require observed natural spawning in four of the five major spawning areas as well as in at least one of the minor spawning areas downstream of Tumwater Dam. In the Methow River, natural spawning should be observed in three major spawning areas. In each case, the major spawning areas should include a minimum of 5% of the total return to the system or 20 redds, whichever is greater. In the Entiat, natural spawning should be observed in both historical major spawning areas, with a distribution criteria similar to the Methow. In the Okanogan, natural spawning should be observed within the two major spawning areas and within at least two of the five minor spawning areas, with a numerical distribution similar to the Methow, across the minor spawning areas. The plan incorporates criteria for spatial structure and diversity adopted from the ICTRT viability report. The mean score for the three metrics representing natural rates and spatially mediated processes should result in a moderate or lower risk in each of the three populations and all threats defined as high risk must be addressed. In addition, the mean score for the eight ICTRT metrics tracking natural levels of variation should result in a moderate or lower risk score at the population level.</p>

<p>Given the recent changes in hatchery practices in the Wenatchee River and the potential for reduced hatchery contributions or increased spatial separation of hatchery vs.&nbsp;natural origin spawners, it is possible that genetic composition could trend towards patterns consistent with strong natural selection influences in the future. Ongoing genetic sampling and analysis could provide information in the future to determine if the diversity risk is abating. The proportions of hatchery-origin returns in natural spawning areas remain high across the DPS, especially in the Methow and Okanogan river populations. Tributary habitat actions called for in the Upper Columbia Recovery Plan are anticipated to be implemented over the next 25 years and the benefits of some of those actions will require some time to be realized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most recent estimates (5-year geometric mean) of total and natural-origin spawner abundance have declined since the last report, largely erasing gains observed over the past two decades for all four populations (Figure 12, Table 6). Recent declines are persistent and large enough to result in small, but negative 15-year trends in abundance for all four populations (Table 7). The abundance and productivity viability rating for the Wenatchee River exceeds the minimum threshold for 5% extinction risk. The overall DPS viability remains unchanged from the prior review, remaining at high risk driven by low abundance and productivity relative to viability objectives and diversity concerns (Table 9).</p>
