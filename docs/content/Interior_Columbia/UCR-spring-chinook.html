<p>The Upper Columbia Spring-Run Chinook salmon ESU includes naturally spawning spring-run Chinook salmon in the major tributaries entering the Columbia River upstream of Rock Island Dam and associated hatchery programs (85 FR 81822; Figure 3). The ESU was listed as Endangered under the ESA in 1999 (affirmed in 2005, 2012 and 2016).</p>

<p><em>2005</em></p>
<p>In the 2005 review, a slight majority (53%) of the cumulative votes cast by the BRT members placed this ESU in the “in danger of extinction” category, with the next category, “likely to become endangered”, receiving a substantial number of votes as well (45%) (Good <em>et al.</em> 2005). The 2005 BRT review noted that Upper Columbia Spring Chinook populations had “rebounded somewhat from the critically low levels” observed in the 1998 review. Although the BRT considered this an encouraging sign, they noted that the increase was largely driven by returns in the two most recent spawning years available at the time of the review. The BRT ratings were also influenced by the fact that two out of the three extant populations in this ESU were subject to extreme hatchery intervention measures in response to the extreme downturn in returns during the 1990s. Good <em>et al</em>. (2005) stated that these measures were “...a strong indication of the ongoing risks to this ESU, although the associated hatchery programs may ultimately play a role in helping to restore naturally self-sustaining populations.”</p>
<p><em>2010 </em></p>
<p>The viability of the ESU in 2010 was reported in Ford <em>et al</em>. (2011). At that time, the Upper Columbia Spring Chinook ESU was not currently meeting the viability criteria (adapted from the ICTRT) in the Upper Columbia Recovery Plan. Increases in natural origin abundance relative to the extremely low spawning levels observed in the mid-1990s were encouraging; however, average productivity levels remained extremely low. Overall, the report concluded that the viability of the Upper Columbia Spring Chinook salmon ESU had likely improved somewhat since the time of the last BRT status review, but the ESU was still clearly at moderate-to-high risk of extinction.</p>
<p><em>2015</em></p>
<p>Estimates of natural origin spawner abundance increased relative to the levels observed in the prior reviews for all three extant populations, and productivities were higher for the Wenatchee and Entiat and unchanged for the Methow (NWFSC 2015). However abundance and productivity remained well below the viable thresholds called for in the Upper Columbia Recovery Plan for all three populations. Based on the information available for the 2015 review, the risk category for the Upper Columbia Spring Chinook ESU remained unchanged from the prior review. Although the viability of the ESU is improved relative to measures available at the time of listing, all three populations remain at high risk.</p>

<p>Annual abundance estimates for each of the extant populations in this ESU are generated based on expansions from redd surveys and carcass sampling. Index area redd counts have been conducted in these river systems since the late 1950’s (Mullan <em>et al.</em> 1992). Multiple pass surveys in index areas complemented by supplemental surveys covering the majority of spawning reaches have been conducted since the mid 1980’s. For more recent years, estimates of annual returns to the Wenatchee River population also reflect counts and sampling data obtained at a trap at the Tumwater Dam on the mainstem river downstream of spring Chinook spawning areas. The data series for each population has been updated to include return years through 2019. Recent year estimates of spawner abundance, hatchery and natural origin proportions and age composition were provided by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, recruits per spawner data for these populations was provided by WDFW and distributed through the Coordinated Assessments data web portal, and smolt to adult return rate data were estimated from PIT tag detections and distributed by the Columbia River Data Access in Real Time data portal[^3].</p>
<p><em>Smolt to Adult Return and Recruits per Spawner Rates</em></p>
<p>Smolt to Adult Return (SAR) estimates (Bonneville to Bonneville) for all three Upper Columbia River Spring Chinook salmon population data series are generated by the Columbia River Data Access in Real Time (CBR &amp; Washington 2020) project using PIT tag detections from all release locations within each population basin (Columbia River DART <em>et al.</em> 2020). The indices represent cumulative marine, nearshore and estuary survival. The SAR series includes estimates for the range of brood years 2002-2015 (Figure 4). Over the period of record, the geometric mean SAR for the Entiat and Methow populations (~3%) represents a low, but reasonable marine survival, with the Wenatchee SAR of ~1.5% being on the low end, as 2% is roughly a replacement rate. Recruits per Spawner (R/S) indices are reported as available from the StreamNet Coordinated Assessments data portal (see footnote). All populations in the ESU have low (&lt; 1.0) R/S values, implying that the natural replacement rate is not keeping up with all sources of mortality across the life-cycle. <img src="./media/media/image9.png" style="width:4.96342in;height:2.65854in"></p>

Geometric means of SAR (%) and R/S (fish/fish) are shown for each population, along with the standard error of the estimate (whiskers represent +/- one standard error).

<h3 data-number="5.3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ocean-condition-indices"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Ocean Condition Indices</h3>
<p>Upper Columbia spring Chinook salmon are a component of the Columbia River spring Chinook run that is believed to occupy mid-shelf waters during the early ocean life history phase. Aggregate annual returns of Columbia River Spring Chinook are correlated with a range of ocean condition indices including measures of broad scale physical conditions, local biological indicators, and local physical factors (Peterson <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Several indicators, either individually or in combination, correlate well with spring Chinook salmon adult returns with a lag of 1 to 2 years. However, for each specific indicator or combination, there are anomalous years that fall outside of the apparent relationships. Work is continuing to further understand the relationships among physical and biological ‘drivers’ and annual levels of ocean survival for salmonid species in the ocean environment. After accounting for age at return at time of ocean entry, the annual pattern in the Upper Columbia spring Chinook ESU SAR index generally corresponds to the composite rankings across ocean indicators available for early ocean years starting in the late 1990s (Peterson <em>et al.</em> 2014b). Indicators of ocean condition are highly correlated with each other, and exhibit strong temporal autocorrelation (Figure 129) (Peterson <em>et al.</em> 2019). As a result, when indicators point to conditions that result in poor ocean productivity for salmonid populations, they do so as a suite of indicators, and for runs of ‘good’ or ‘bad’ years (see Habitat chapter). Historically, ocean conditions cycled between periods of high and low productivity. However, global climate change is likely to disrupt this pattern, in general, leading to a preponderance of low productivity years, with an unknown temporal distribution (Crozier <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Recent (2015-2019) ensemble ocean indicators rankings include four of the worst seven years in the past 20, meaning that an entire Chinook salmon generation has been subjected to poor ocean productivity conditions (Figure 129).</p>

<h2 data-number="5.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="abundance-and-productivity"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Abundance and productivity</h2>
<p>Updated data series on spawner abundance, age structure and hatchery/natural proportions were used to generate current assessments of abundance and productivity at the population level. Evaluations were done using both a set of metrics similar to those used in prior Biological Review Team (BRT) reviews (see Methods) as well as a set corresponding to the specific viability criteria based on ICTRT recommendations for this ESU. The BRT level metrics were consistently done across all ESUs and DPSs to facilitate comparisons across domains. Assessments using the ICTRT metrics are described in the TRT and Recovery Plan Criteria section below. The ICTRT abundance and productivity metrics are measured over longer time frames to dampen the effects of annual variations and they use annual natural origin age composition to calculate brood year recruitment when sampling levels meet regional fishery agency criteria.</p>
<p>Annual spawning escapements for all three of the extant Upper Columbia spring Chinook populations showed steep declines beginning in the late 1980s, leading to extremely low abundance levels in the mid-1990s (Figure 5, Table 2). The steep downward trend reflects the extremely low return rates for natural production from the 1990-94 brood years (Figure 6). Estimated replacement rates were consistently below 1.0 even at low parent spawner levels throughout the 1990s. Steeply declining trends across indices of total spawner abundance were a major consideration in the 1998 BRT risk assessment prior to listing of the ESU. Using the updated data series for this review, the short-term (5 year) trend in wild spawners has been strongly negative for all three extant populations (Table 2). Longer term (15 year) trends are also negative for all three populations, although the 95% confidence intervals in each case include 0 (Table 3). In general, both total and natural origin escapements for all three populations increased sharply from 1999 through 2002 and have shown substantial year to year variations in the years following, with peaks around 2001 and 2010 and declines after 2010. Average natural origin returns remain well below ICTRT minimum threshold levels.</p>

<p>Figure . Smoothed trend in estimated total (thick black line, with 95% confidence internal in gray) and natural (thin red line) population spawning abundance. In portions of a time series where a population has no annual estimates but smoothed spawning abundance is estimated from correlations with other populations the smoothed estimate is shown in light gray. Points show the annual raw spawning abundance estimates. For some trends the smoothed estimate may be influenced by earlier data points not included in the plot.</p>
<p>The annual natural return per spawner series for each population directly reflects the patterns in natural origin abundance and was only positive during a period of strong population increase Figure 6). Brood year escapements with positive return per spawner values are associated with those years leading up to the peaks in natural origin spawner returns in each series. Using the R/S and SAR indicators by population (Figure 4), it is possible to generate an indicator of fresh water productivity (FWPI) as a ratio of R/S and SAR. This quantity can be thought of as an indicator of smolts per spawner, and thus, the overall population productivity in the freshwater environment. FWPI for Upper Columbia Spring Chinook populations are low (&lt;100, Figure 7), confirming areas of recovery action focus such as pre-spawn mortality and juvenile rearing habitat condition. The initial risk assessment for this ESU (ICTRT 2007) found that achieving natural origin abundance and productivity levels above the threshold viability curve corresponding to 5% risk in extinction will require substantial improvements in survival and/or natural production capacity. The long-term population productivity data indicates that this assessment is still valid.</p>

<p>Spring Chinook salmon from the upper Columbia basin migrate offshore in marine water and where impacts in ocean salmon fisheries are too low to be quantified. The only significant harvest in salmon fisheries occurs in the mainstem Columbia River in tribal and non-tribal fisheries directed at hatchery spring Chinook salmon from the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. Exploitation rates have remained relatively low, generally below the target rate of 2%(Figure 8).</p>

<p>The proportions of natural origin contributions to spawning in the Wenatchee and Methow populations have trended downwards from 1990 to 2008 (Figure 9, Table 4), reflecting the large increase in releases and subsequent returns from the directed supplementation programs in those two drainages (Hillman <em>et al.</em> 2015). Natural origin fractions increased from 2009 to 2017, reflecting increasing natural origin abundance trends and changes to hatchery management, before declining again in the two years. There is currently no direct spring run hatchery supplementation program in the Entiat River, though the summer run releases do have the potential to impact the spring run through redd superimposition. Prior to 2011, hatchery-origin spawners in the Entiat River system are predominately strays from Entiat NFH releases. The Entiat NFH spring Chinook release program was discontinued in 2007, and the upward trend in proportional natural origin since then can be attributed to that closure. In recent years, hatchery supplementation returns from the adjacent Wenatchee River program have also strayed into the Entiat (Ford <em>et al.</em> 2015). The nearby Eastbank Hatchery facility is used for rearing the Wenatchee River supplementation stock prior to transfer to the Chiwawa acclimation pond. It is possible that some of the returns from that program are homing on the Eastbank facility and then straying into the Entiat River, the nearest spawning area.</p>

<p>NOAA Fisheries (National Marine Fisheries Service adopted a recovery plan for Upper Columbia Spring Chinook and steelhead in 2007 (FR 72 #194. 57303-57307). The Plan was developed by the Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Board (UCSRB) and is available through their website (http://www.ucsrb.com/). The Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Plan’s overall goal is “...to achieve recovery and delisting of spring Chinook salmon and steelhead by ensuring the long-term persistence of viable populations of naturally produced fish distributed across their native range.”</p>
<p>Two incremental levels of recovery objectives are incorporated into the Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Plan. Increasing natural production sufficiently to upgrade each Upper Columbia River ESU from “endangered” to “threatened” status is stated as an initial objective. The Plan includes three specific quantitative reclassification criteria expressed relative to population viability curves (ICTRT 2007a). Abundance and productivity of natural origin spring Chinook salmon within each of the extant Upper Columbia populations, measured as 8-year geometric means (representing approximately two generations), must fall above the viability curve representing the minimum combinations projecting to a 10% risk of extinction over 100 years. In addition, the plan incorporates explicit criteria for spatial structure and diversity adopted from the ICTRT viability report. The mean score for the three metrics representing natural rates and spatially mediated processes should result in a moderate or lower risk in each of the three populations and all threats defined as high risk must be addressed. In addition, the mean score for the eight ICTRT metrics tracking natural levels of variation should result in a moderate or lower risk score at the population level.</p>
<p>Achieving recovery (delisting) of each ESU via sufficient improvement in the abundance, productivity, spatial structure and diversity is the longer-term goal of the UCSRB Plan. The Plan includes two specific quantitative criteria for assessing the status of the Spring Chinook ESU against the recovery objective; “The 12-year geometric mean (representing approximately three generations) of abundance and productivity of naturally produced spring Chinook within the Wenatchee, Entiat and Methow populations must reach a level that would have not less than a 5% extinction-risk (viability) over a 100 year period” and “at a minimum, the Upper Columbia Spring Chinook ESU will maintain at least 4,500 naturally produced spawners and a spawner:spawner ratio greater than 1:1 distributed among the three populations”. The minimum number of naturally produced spawners (expressed as 12 year geometric means) should exceed 2,000 each for the Wenatchee and Methow River populations and 500 within the Entiat River. Minimum productivity thresholds were also established in the Plan. The 12-year geometric mean productivity should exceed 1.2 spawners per parent spawner for the two larger populations (Wenatchee and Methow Rivers), and 1.4 for the smaller Entiat River population. The ICTRT had recommended that at least two of the three extant populations be targeted for highly viable status (less than 1% risk of extinction over 100 years) because of the relatively low number of extant populations remaining in the ESU. The UC Plan adopted an alternative approach for addressing the limited number of populations in the ESU – 5% or less risk of extinction for all three extant populations.</p>
<p>The Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Plan also calls for ’… restoring the distribution of naturally produced spring Chinook salmon and steelhead to previously occupied areas where practical; and conserving their genetic and phenotypic diversity.” Specific criteria included in the UCSRB Plan reflect a combination of the specific criteria recommended by the ICTRT (ICTRT 2007) and in the earlier QAR effort (Ford <em>et al.</em> 2001). The Plan incorporates spatial structure criteria specific to each spring Chinook salmon population. For the Wenatchee River population, the criteria call for observed natural spawning in four of the five major spawning areas as well as in at least one of the minor spawning areas downstream of Tumwater Dam. In the Methow River, natural spawning should be observed in three major spawning areas. In each case, the major spawning areas should include a minimum of 5% of the total return to the system or 20 redds, whichever is greater. The Entiat River Spring Chinook population includes a single historical major spawning area.</p>

<p>##Recovery Update</p>
<p>The UCSRB Plan calls for meeting or exceeding the same basic spatial structure and diversity criteria adopted from the ICTRT viability report for recovery.</p>
<p>Overall abundance and productivity (A/P) remains rated at high risk for the each of the three extant populations in this MPG/ESU (Table 5). The 10-year geometric mean abundance of adult natural-origin spawners has not changed by more than 25% relative to the levels reported in the 2015 status update. Natural origin escapements still remains well below the corresponding ICTRT thresholds for all populations. The combinations of current abundance and productivity for each population result in a high risk rating when compared to the ICTRT viability curves.</p>
<p>The composite spatial structure/diversity (SS/D) risks for all three of the extant populations in this MPG are rated at high (Table 5). The spatial processes component of the SS/D risk is low for the Wenatchee and Methow river populations and moderate for the Entiat River (due to a loss of production in lower section which increases effective distance to other populations). All three of the extant populations in this MPG are rated at high risk for diversity, driven primarily by chronically high proportions of hatchery-origin spawners in natural spawning areas and lack of genetic diversity among the natural-origin spawners (ICTRT 2007).</p>
<p>Based on the combined ratings for A/P and SS/D, all three of the extant populations of Upper Columbia spring Chinook salmon remain rated at high overall risk (Table 5).</p>

<h2 data-number="5.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="updated-biological-risk-summary"><span class="header-section-number">5.7</span> Updated biological risk summary</h2>
<p>Current estimates of natural origin spawner abundance decreased substantially relative to the levels observed in the prior review for all three extant populations. Productivities also continued to be very low and both abundance and productivity remained well below the viable thresholds called for in the Upper Columbia Recovery Plan for all three populations. Short-term patterns in those indicators appear to be largely driven by year-to year fluctuations in survival rates in areas outside of these watersheds, in particular a recent run of poor ocean condition years. All three populations continued to be rated at low risk for spatial structure but at high risk for diversity criteria. Large-scale supplementation efforts in the Methow and Wenatchee Rivers are ongoing, intended to counter short-term demographic risks given current average survival levels and the associated year-to-year variability. Under the current recovery plan, habitat protection and restoration actions are being implemented that are directed at key limiting factors.</p>
<p>Given the high degree of year-to-year variability in life stage survivals and the time lags resulting from the 5-year life cycle of the populations, it is not possible to detect incremental gains from habitat actions implemented to date in population level measures of adult abundance or productivity. Efforts are underway to develop life stage specific estimates of performance (survival and capacities) and to use a life cycle model framework to evaluate progress (Zabel &amp; Jordan 2020, chapter 6). Based on the information available for this review, the risk category for the Upper Columbia Spring Chinook ESU remains unchanged from the prior review (NWFSC 2015). Although the viability of the ESU remains improved relative to measures available at the time of listing, all three populations remain at high risk.</p>
