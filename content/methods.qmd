title: Methods
---

This report includes both a set of common analyses conducted for each
ESU as well as in some cases ESU-specific analyses developed by the
individual technical recovery teams (TRTs).  Here, we describe only the
common set of analyses; see the individual sections for a description of
the analyses that pertain to specific ESUs.  Abundance and productivity
were generally analyzed using quantitative methods, while spatial
structure and diversity were analyzed qualitatively.

*Spawning abundance and trends --* All of the Pacific Northwest TRTs
spent considerable time and effort developing spawning abundance data
for the populations they identified within ESUs.  In almost all cases
these estimates are derived from state, tribal or federal monitoring
programs.  The raw information upon which the spawning abundance
estimates were developed consists of numerous types of data, including
redd counts, dam counts, carcass surveys, information on pre-spawning
mortality, and distribution within populations, which the TRTs used to
develop estimates of natural origin spawning abundance.  It is important
to recognize that spawning abundance estimates and related information
such as the fraction of spawners that are natural origin are not in most
cases 'facts' that are known with certainty. Rather, they typically are
estimates based on a variety of sources of information, some known with
greater precision or accuracy than others. Ideally, these estimates
would be characterized by a good understanding of the degree of
variation due to measurement error.  However, for the most part such a
statistical characterization is either not possible or has not been
attempted, although many improvements have been made in the last decade
(see specific chapters for details). The spawning time series summarized
here and references to the methods and sources for their development are
available from the Northwest Fisheries Science Center's Salmon
Population Summary database and are also discussed in the ESU-specific
chapters.

## Common metrics

Multivariate dynamic linear modeling (DLM) was used to estimate
population-specific mean trends in each ESU from the log of total
spawner counts. The result is an estimate of the mean or smoothed total
spawner counts, from which summary statistics regarding trends were
computed.  We focus exclusively on fish spawning in nature, but often
these naturally spawning populations include some numbers of
hatchery-origin fish, either as part of a deliberate supplementation
effort or due to straying from hatchery programs.  For the rest of this
report, a "natural-origin" or "wild" fish refers to a fish whose parents
spawned naturally, and a "hatchery-origin" fish refers to a fish whose
parents were spawned in a hatchery, regardless of prior generation
origin.  

In order to estimate the trend of natural-origin spawners in populations
that also include hatchery-origin spawners, a univariate DLM was applied
to the logit of the fraction natural-origin estimate to produce a
smoothed proportion natural-origin time series.  This was used to
produce an estimate of the mean natural-origin spawners for years when
fraction natural-origin estimates were unavailable.

The mean or smoothed total spawner count is similar in concept to a 3-
or 5-year geometric mean; the goal is the same---to produce an estimate
that smooths over single year variation.  Such variation arises from
observation error in the spawning counts and also from peaks and troughs
in spawners numbers due to the life-history of salmonids or
environmental variation.  The multivariate DLM approach has a number of
advantages.  Most importantly it is a statistical model for which
maximum-likelihood diagnostics, model selection criteria, and confidence
intervals are available. It is a time-series model, which addresses
temporal autocorrelation in the data.  Where there are missing data, it
provides an estimate for the missing year with appropriately wider
confidence intervals.  And lastly, it allows us to use information
across all populations within an ESU to estimate the level of
year-to-year variation in the mean spawner count---the process
variance---and allows us to estimate the year-to-year covariance, which
is often high, across populations within an ESU.  The latter improves
estimation of missing values because populations with data in one year
help inform the values for populations with missing data that year.

## Dynamic linear modeling for time-varying trend estimation

Dynamic linear models (DLMs) are similar to linear regression models
with a yearly trend.  Like a classic trend analysis using linear
regression, the goal is to estimate the mean spawner count at *x*, where
*x* is year (time).  Linear regression models, however, use a
time-constant yearly trend (which appears as the regression line versus
time) while DLMs allow the trend to be time-varying.

In mathematical terms this means that the classic linear regression of
log spawners (*y*) against year treats the trend (β) or yearly growth in
the mean spawner count as a constant and fits the following model:

![https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SdhTrJsby9BdaFKSG02iCM5Xd3fapEiehHf2ByZO1kmQoAnGvqc34L6YkkcSIS89bm5xgfqTx6G_4xlKYhR5W4eMAsDKEYGCumZTaFMQBPyLFy_MPyYO_AFsopCd3wgY8tvI9A](./media/media/image1.png){width="1.2105260279965004in"
height="0.5476192038495188in"}

where *y~t\ ~*are the observations, yt is the mean of *y~t~* and *v~t~*
are normal-distributed errors.  The mean spawner count in year *t* is
the mean spawner count in year *t −* 1 plus the constant trend value β.
Normally, we write this model in classic linear regression form as

![https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nfXDNpAlVNxUqhVt-cH8N_974BMLENGTY1pixZZVxt1uirEHCtHYAZgCa-0nc5879y02yE9MWG7l2LVZejmTG7MsIVExT172KGNpnJvHeFVfYCpOwOSIYWWO5xvIapJhkUx11A](./media/media/image2.png){width="1.375in"
height="0.3854166666666667in"}

with the mean of *y~t~  *equal to α + β*t*.  A DLM, in contrast, allows
us to fit a model with a time-varying β. Specifically, the following
model

![https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2IiVCR0lye4NIn7r-GM8AnNv97nrnsN-9HoAnJXEmTPVa-6e6pRKew4ZQRbTtDQwrDD7US-IGC1n-zp0I5XErfkFKV3tMBn_mgJsRnUIaHx5NCVON-jm2k-dVC2AhgPX8xk2Gg](./media/media/image3.png){width="2.2604166666666665in"
height="0.59375in"}

The time-varying β is modeled as *u* + *w~t~*, where *w~t~* is a
normally distributed random variable.  

Figure 1 shows example spawner data where a time-varying sinusoidal β
(yearly growth rate) was used to generate counts (the circles) using the
DLM model above.   The black line in the top panel of Figure 1 shows the
true mean *y*.  The red line shows the estimate from a linear regression
of *y* against year with a non-time-varying β.  The blue line shows the
estimate from a DLM where the β is allowed to vary in time.  The bottom
panel shows the estimate of β compared to the true sinusoidal β that
generated the data.  This illustrates the power of DLM when the
objective is to estimate a time-varying trend. 

## Multivariate DLMs for analysis of multiple time series from one ESU

A multivariate DLM allows one to estimate time-varying trends using a
multiple observed time series, in our case populations within ESU, where
parameter sharing is allowed across the time series. Specifically, one
can constrain the variances to be the same across time series and to
allow covariance across time series.  The latter allows information from
time series with data in year *t* to help inform the estimate of mean
*y* for time series that have no data in year *t*. The multivariate DLM
allowed us to use all spawner count information in the ESU to deal with
measurement error in the spawner count data and more importantly to
estimate missing spawner count data.

Mathematically, the model being fit is

height="1.3958333333333333in"}

The *u~j~* are the long-term mean of β*~j,t~* .  The trend at year *t*
is β*~j,t~* = *u~j~* + *w~j,t~* .  The *w~t~* and *v~t~ * are error
terms drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with
variance-covariance matrix **Q** and **R** respectively.  The structure
of **Q** and **R** allows one to specify different types of parameter
constraints (for example equal variances across populations).

## Model selection

Model selection was used to select the structure of **Q** and **R**. The
following structures were explored for **Q**: diagonal with unequal
variances (no covariance across populations in terms of good and bad
years and populations allowed to have different year-to-year
variability), diagonal with equal variances (no covariance across
populations and populations constrained to have the same year-to-year
variability), one variance and one covariance across all populations,
equal variances and covariances across similar run timings in a
population, and unconstrained (unique variances and covariances across
all populations).  For **R** the following structures were explored:
diagonal with unequal variances (no covariance) and diagonal with equal
variances.  The **R** represents the residual non-time-dependent error
and was assumed not to covary across populations (**Q** and **R** cannot
both have covariance terms in the DLM due to identifiability
constraints).  Across the majority of ESUs, model selection gave the
most data support (quantified with AICc) to a **Q** with one variance
and one covariance across all populations in an ESU and an **R**, the
residual variance-covariance matrix, with one variance across
populations.  Because **Q** has covariance terms, estimates of mean
spawner numbers can be provided for populations with missing data
because the data from other populations helps inform the estimates
(Figure 2 shows an example).

Figure . This figure compares a trend analysis using a non-time-varying
trend (red line) via linear regression versus a trend analysis using a
time-varying trend (blue line). The black line is the true line we are
trying to estimate (with the red or blue line) and the dots in the top
panel are the observations of the black line. In the top plot, y is the
log-spawners. The trend in the lower plot is the yearly change in
log-spawners.

### Code to fit a multivariate DLM

The MARSS R package was used to fit multivariate DLMs to the log-spawner
counts (or indices in some cases). The package handles missing data
entered as NAs for missing years. The following example code fits 2
time-series via a multivariate DLM using the MARSS R package:

*library(MARSS)*

*logspawners = log(matrix(c(*

*  1106, 1503, 853, 566, 251, 424, 783, 639, 566, 413, 1035, 890,*

*  7348, 6880, 2699, 1096, NA, NA, NA, 1318, 1127, 472, 637, 869*

*  ), 2,12, byrow=TRUE))*

*model=list(*

*  Q=\"equalvarcov\",*

*  R=\"diagonal and equal\",*

*  U=\"unequal\")*

*fit=MARSS(logspawners, model=model)*

## Natural-origin spawner estimates

For some populations, there were estimates of the fraction of total
natural spawners that were of natural-origin.  However, for many
populations, these data were noisy and had many missing years. In
addition, the number of years with fraction natural-origin information
was often shorter than the years with total spawner counts.  To estimate
a mean natural-origin spawner estimate, similar to the mean total
spawner estimate, the mean total spawner estimate was multiplied by a
smoothed estimate of the fraction natural-origin.  The smoothed estimate
was produced by fitting a univariate DLM to the logit *z~t~* = log(*f
/*(1 *− f* )) of the fraction natural-origin estimates with a
time-varying β. Specifically, the following model was fit:

*\
\
*![https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4ZHhRk8_wRCjG0BdhNzQnR_STBIbVXkqr3Q9Bf9H26WIAYeX0ZPX6GnZd1xKgdoNBFi1-ZO2s_tB1ZAyuWOmkMUMvT_bRFGtKS-vVXUDjZ7mPUpra7CQ4f6Oh0uFAwOFxuMHRA](./media/media/image6.png){width="1.25in"
height="0.4583333333333333in"}

The mean natural-origin spawner estimate at time *t* was then *y*¯*~t~
exp(z*¯*~t~ )/*(exp(*z*¯*~t~ )*+ 1).  Each time series of fraction
natural-origin from each population was fit independently (no covariance
assumed across populations). Missing values were allowed within the
fraction natural-origin time series and would be estimated by the DLM,
however no estimates were used more than 1-year before the available
data or 1-year after. For example, if the natural origin data started in
2001, then the first DLM estimate would be for 2000. This prevent the
model from extrapolating too far outside the data.

Notice that the information from the years when data are available for
time-series 1 are used to inform the estimate for time-series 2 for the
missing years (marked with a circle). 

## Summary statistics

The following summary statistics were reported for all ESUs: the mean
total spawner DLM estimates (from the multivariate DLM fit to the raw
total spawners time series in the ESU), the mean natural origin spawner
DLM estimates (the total spawner DLM estimate times the fraction natural
origin DLM estimate), and the raw (original data) total spawners and the
raw natural origin spawner estimates (raw total times fraction natural
origin).  The definition of 'spawner' with respect to age varied
somewhat across data sources and was dependent in some cases upon
decisions made by data providers. For Chinook salmon, jacks (males one
year younger than the model age) were included as spawners in most cases
but 'mini-jacks' (males two or more years younger than the model age)
were never included. Jacks were not included for coho salmon. For
steelhead, only anadromous spawners were included.

These metrics are similar to statistics reported in prior viability
reports and provide a common set of relatively simple metrics for
comparison across all ESU/DPS and populations and with prior reports. In
most cases, there are also ESU/DPS-specific metrics that were developed
by technical recovery teams and/or included in recovery plans. Where
feasible, these metrics are also reported in the individual ESU/DPS
chapters.

**15-year trends. ** A linear regression was fit to 15 years of the 
mean natural origin spawner DLM estimates and the slope (trend)
reported. The 15-year time period was chosen to remain consistent with
prior viability reports and does not necessarily correspond to any peaks
or troughs in the time series.

**5-year geometric means. ** 5-year geometric means (*y*~1~*y*~2~*y*~3~
*y*~4~*y*~5~)^(1*/*5)^ were computed from the raw total natural spawner
and natural origin spawner DLM estimates. The raw data could have
missing values in the calculation, while the DLM estimates would not.
For the raw estimates, when there were missing values, the geometric
mean was computed only from the non-missing values. For example, if 3
values were available, (*y*~1~*y*~2~*y*~3~)^(1*/*3)^ was reported.

**Average fraction natural origin. ** These were computed over 5-year
time frames from the raw estimates of fraction natural-origin.

**Productivity metric. ** Because age of return data were not
consistently available across all ESUs and populations, a generic
productivity metric was computed as the mean natural-origin spawner DLM
estimate at year *t* divided by the mean total spawner DLM estimate at
year *t −* 3 for coho salmon and *t −* 4 for all other species. This
metric was plotted for all years of available data.

**Harvest.** * *We compiled data on trends in the adult equivalent
exploitation rate for each ESU.  This information was used to provide
some additional context for interpreting abundance trends, similar to
the environmental trend information we also report. It is important to
note that magnitude and trend of an exploitation rate cannot be
interpreted uncritically as a trend in level of risk from harvest. 
Analyses relating exploitation rate to extinction risk or recovery
probability have been conducted in a quantitative way for several ESUs (
e.g., NMFS 2001; Ford *et al.* 2007; NWFSC 2010) and qualitatively for
others (NMFS 2004).  See specific sections for details.
