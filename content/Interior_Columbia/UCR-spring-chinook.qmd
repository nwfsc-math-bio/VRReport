---

## Brief description of ESU

The Upper Columbia Spring-Run Chinook salmon ESU includes naturally
spawning spring-run Chinook salmon in the major tributaries entering the
Columbia River upstream of Rock Island Dam and associated hatchery
programs (85 FR 81822; Figure 3).  The ESU was listed as Endangered
under the ESA in 1999 (affirmed in 2005, 2012 and 2016).

## Summary of previous viability conclusions

*2005*

In the 2005 review, a slight majority (53%) of the cumulative votes cast
by the BRT members placed this ESU in the "in danger of extinction"
category, with the next category, "likely to become endangered",
receiving a substantial number of votes as well (45%) (Good *et al.*
2005).  The 2005 BRT review noted that Upper Columbia Spring Chinook
populations had "rebounded somewhat from the critically low levels"
observed in the 1998 review.  Although the BRT considered this an
encouraging sign, they noted that the increase was largely driven by
returns in the two most recent spawning years available at the time of
the review.  The BRT ratings were also influenced by the fact that two
out of the three extant populations in this ESU were subject to extreme
hatchery intervention measures in response to the extreme downturn in
returns during the 1990s.  Good *et al*. (2005) stated that these
measures were "\...a strong indication of the ongoing risks to this ESU,
although the associated hatchery programs may ultimately play a role in
helping to restore naturally self-sustaining populations."

*2010 *

The viability of the ESU in 2010 was reported in Ford *et al*. (2011). 
At that time, the Upper Columbia Spring Chinook ESU was not currently
meeting the viability criteria (adapted from the ICTRT) in the Upper
Columbia Recovery Plan.  Increases in natural origin abundance relative
to the extremely low spawning levels observed in the mid-1990s were
encouraging; however, average productivity levels remained extremely
low.  Overall, the report concluded that the viability of the Upper
Columbia Spring Chinook salmon ESU had likely improved somewhat since
the time of the last BRT status review, but the ESU was still clearly at
moderate-to-high risk of extinction.   

*2015*

Estimates of natural origin spawner abundance increased relative to the
levels observed in the prior reviews for all three extant populations,
and productivities were higher for the Wenatchee and Entiat and
unchanged for the Methow (NWFSC 2015).  However abundance and
productivity remained well below the viable thresholds called for in the
Upper Columbia Recovery Plan for all three populations.  Based on the
information available for the 2015 review, the risk category for the
Upper Columbia Spring Chinook ESU remained unchanged from the prior
review.  Although the viability of the ESU is improved relative to
measures available at the time of listing, all three populations remain
at high risk. 

## Description of new data available for this review

Annual abundance estimates for each of the extant populations in this
ESU are generated based on expansions from redd surveys and carcass
sampling.  Index area redd counts have been conducted in these river
systems since the late 1950's (Mullan *et al.* 1992).  Multiple pass
surveys in index areas complemented by supplemental surveys covering the
majority of spawning reaches have been conducted since the mid 1980's. 
For more recent years, estimates of annual returns to the Wenatchee
River population also reflect counts and sampling data obtained at a
trap at the Tumwater Dam on the mainstem river downstream of spring
Chinook spawning areas.  The data series for each population has been
updated to include return years through 2019.  Recent year estimates of
spawner abundance, hatchery and natural origin proportions and age
composition were provided by the Washington Department of Fish and
Wildlife, recruits per spawner data for these populations was provided
by WDFW and distributed through the Coordinated Assessments data web
portal, and smolt to adult return rate data were estimated from PIT tag
detections and distributed by the Columbia River Data Access in Real
Time data portal[^3].

*Smolt to Adult Return and Recruits per Spawner Rates*

Smolt to Adult Return (SAR) estimates (Bonneville to Bonneville) for all
three Upper Columbia River Spring Chinook salmon population data series
are generated by the Columbia River Data Access in Real Time (CBR &
Washington 2020) project using PIT tag detections from all release
locations within each population basin (Columbia River DART *et al.*
2020). The indices represent cumulative marine, nearshore and estuary
survival. The SAR series includes estimates for the range of brood years
2002-2015 (Figure 4). Over the period of record, the geometric mean SAR
for the Entiat and Methow populations (\~3%) represents a low, but
reasonable marine survival, with the Wenatchee SAR of \~1.5% being on
the low end, as 2% is roughly a replacement rate. Recruits per Spawner
(R/S) indices are reported as available from the StreamNet Coordinated
Assessments data portal (see footnote). All populations in the ESU have
low (\< 1.0) R/S values, implying that the natural replacement rate is
not keeping up with all sources of mortality across the life-cycle.

### Ocean Condition Indices

Upper Columbia spring Chinook salmon are a component of the Columbia
River spring Chinook run that is believed to occupy mid-shelf waters
during the early ocean life history phase. Aggregate annual returns of
Columbia River Spring Chinook are correlated with a range of ocean
condition indices including measures of broad scale physical conditions,
local biological indicators, and local physical factors (Peterson *et
al.* 2014a).  Several indicators, either individually or in combination,
correlate well with spring Chinook salmon adult returns with a lag of 1
to 2 years.  However, for each specific indicator or combination, there
are anomalous years that fall outside of the apparent relationships. 
Work is continuing to further understand the relationships among
physical and biological 'drivers' and annual levels of ocean survival
for salmonid species in the ocean environment.  After accounting for age
at return at time of ocean entry, the annual pattern in the Upper
Columbia spring Chinook ESU SAR index generally corresponds to the
composite rankings across ocean indicators available for early ocean
years starting in the late 1990s (Peterson *et al.* 2014b). Indicators
of ocean condition are highly correlated with each other, and exhibit
strong temporal autocorrelation (Figure 129) (Peterson *et al.* 2019).
As a result, when indicators point to conditions that result in poor
ocean productivity for salmonid populations, they do so as a suite of
indicators, and for runs of 'good' or 'bad' years (see Habitat chapter).
Historically, ocean conditions cycled between periods of high and low
productivity. However, global climate change is likely to disrupt this
pattern, in general, leading to a preponderance of low productivity
years, with an unknown temporal distribution (Crozier *et al.* 2019b).
Recent (2015-2019) ensemble ocean indicators rankings include four of
the worst seven years in the past 20, meaning that an entire Chinook
salmon generation has been subjected to poor ocean productivity
conditions (Figure 129).

## Abundance and productivity

Updated data series on spawner abundance, age structure and
hatchery/natural proportions were used to generate current assessments
of abundance and productivity at the population level.  Evaluations were
done using both a set of metrics similar to those used in prior
Biological Review Team (BRT) reviews (see Methods) as well as a set
corresponding to the specific viability criteria based on ICTRT
recommendations for this ESU.  The BRT level metrics were consistently
done across all ESUs and DPSs to facilitate comparisons across domains. 
Assessments using the ICTRT metrics are described in the TRT and
Recovery Plan Criteria section below.  The ICTRT abundance and
productivity metrics are measured over longer time frames to dampen the
effects of annual variations and they use annual natural origin age
composition to calculate brood year recruitment when sampling levels
meet regional fishery agency criteria.

Annual spawning escapements for all three of the extant Upper Columbia
spring Chinook populations showed steep declines beginning in the late
1980s, leading to extremely low abundance levels in the mid-1990s
(Figure 5, Table 2).  The steep downward trend reflects the extremely
low return rates for natural production from the 1990-94 brood years
(Figure 6).  Estimated replacement rates were consistently below 1.0
even at low parent spawner levels throughout the 1990s.  Steeply
declining trends across indices of total spawner abundance were a major
consideration in the 1998 BRT risk assessment prior to listing of the
ESU.  Using the updated data series for this review, the short-term (5
year) trend in wild spawners has been strongly negative for all three
extant populations (Table 2). Longer term (15 year) trends are also
negative for all three populations, although the 95% confidence
intervals in each case include 0 (Table 3). In general, both total and
natural origin escapements for all three populations increased sharply
from 1999 through 2002 and have shown substantial year to year
variations in the years following, with peaks around 2001 and 2010 and
declines after 2010.  Average natural origin returns remain well below
ICTRT minimum threshold levels.

Figure . Smoothed trend in estimated total (thick black line, with 95%
confidence internal in gray) and natural (thin red line) population
spawning abundance.  In portions of a time series where a population has
no annual estimates but smoothed spawning abundance is estimated from
correlations with other populations the smoothed estimate is shown in
light gray. Points show the annual raw spawning abundance
estimates.  For some trends the smoothed estimate may be influenced by
earlier data points not included in the plot.

The annual natural return per spawner series for each population
directly reflects the patterns in natural origin abundance and was only
positive during a period of strong population increase Figure 6).  Brood
year escapements with positive return per spawner values are associated
with those years leading up to the peaks in natural origin spawner
returns in each series. Using the R/S and SAR indicators by population
(Figure 4), it is possible to generate an indicator of fresh water
productivity (FWPI) as a ratio of R/S and SAR. This quantity can be
thought of as an indicator of smolts per spawner, and thus, the overall
population productivity in the freshwater environment. FWPI for Upper
Columbia Spring Chinook populations are low (\<100, Figure 7),
confirming areas of recovery action focus such as pre-spawn mortality
and juvenile rearing habitat condition. The initial risk assessment for
this ESU (ICTRT 2007) found that achieving natural origin abundance and
productivity levels above the threshold viability curve corresponding to
5% risk in extinction will require substantial improvements in survival
and/or natural production capacity. The long-term population
productivity data indicates that this assessment is still valid.

### Non-treaty Harvest

Spring Chinook salmon from the upper Columbia basin migrate offshore in
marine water and where impacts in ocean salmon fisheries are too low to
be quantified.  The only significant harvest in salmon fisheries occurs
in the mainstem Columbia River in tribal and non-tribal fisheries
directed at hatchery spring Chinook salmon from the Columbia and
Willamette Rivers.  Exploitation rates have remained relatively low,
generally below the target rate of 2%(Figure 8).

salmon.  Data from the Columbia River Technical Advisory Committee (TAC
(U.S. v Oregon Technical Advisory Committee) 2020).

## Spatial structure and diversity

The proportions of natural origin contributions to spawning in the
Wenatchee and Methow populations have trended downwards from 1990 to
2008 (Figure 9, Table 4), reflecting the large increase in releases and
subsequent returns from the directed supplementation programs in those
two drainages (Hillman *et al.* 2015).  Natural origin fractions
increased from 2009 to 2017, reflecting increasing natural origin
abundance trends and changes to hatchery management, before declining
again in the two years. There is currently no direct spring run hatchery
supplementation program in the Entiat River, though the summer run
releases do have the potential to impact the spring run through redd
superimposition.  Prior to 2011, hatchery-origin spawners in the Entiat
River system are predominately strays from Entiat NFH releases.  The
Entiat NFH spring Chinook release program was discontinued in 2007, and
the upward trend in proportional natural origin since then can be
attributed to that closure. In recent years, hatchery supplementation
returns from the adjacent Wenatchee River program have also strayed into
the Entiat (Ford *et al.* 2015). The nearby Eastbank Hatchery facility
is used for rearing the Wenatchee River supplementation stock prior to
transfer to the Chiwawa acclimation pond. It is possible that some of
the returns from that program are homing on the Eastbank facility and
then straying into the Entiat River, the nearest spawning area.

## Biological viability relative to recovery goals

NOAA Fisheries (National Marine Fisheries Service adopted a recovery
plan for Upper Columbia Spring Chinook and steelhead in 2007 (FR 72
#194. 57303-57307).  The Plan was developed by the Upper Columbia Salmon
Recovery Board (UCSRB) and is available through their website
(http://www.ucsrb.com/).  The Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Plan's
overall goal is "\...to achieve recovery and delisting of spring Chinook
salmon and steelhead by ensuring the long-term persistence of viable
populations of naturally produced fish distributed across their native
range."   

Two incremental levels of recovery objectives are incorporated into the
Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Plan.  Increasing natural production
sufficiently to upgrade each Upper Columbia River ESU from "endangered"
to "threatened" status is stated as an initial objective.  The Plan
includes three specific quantitative reclassification criteria expressed
relative to population viability curves (ICTRT 2007a).  Abundance and
productivity of natural origin spring Chinook salmon within each of the
extant Upper Columbia populations, measured as 8-year geometric means
(representing approximately two generations), must fall above the
viability curve representing the minimum combinations projecting to a
10% risk of extinction over 100 years.  In addition, the plan
incorporates explicit criteria for spatial structure and diversity
adopted from the ICTRT viability report.  The mean score for the three
metrics representing natural rates and spatially mediated processes
should result in a moderate or lower risk in each of the three
populations and all threats defined as high risk must be addressed.  In
addition, the mean score for the eight ICTRT metrics tracking natural
levels of variation should result in a moderate or lower risk score at
the population level. 

Achieving recovery (delisting) of each ESU via sufficient improvement in
the abundance, productivity, spatial structure and diversity is the
longer-term goal of the UCSRB Plan.  The Plan includes two specific
quantitative criteria for assessing the status of the Spring Chinook ESU
against the recovery objective;  "The 12-year geometric mean
(representing approximately three generations) of abundance and
productivity of naturally produced spring Chinook within the Wenatchee,
Entiat and Methow populations must reach a level that would have not
less than a 5% extinction-risk (viability) over a 100 year period" and
"at a minimum, the Upper Columbia Spring Chinook ESU will maintain at
least 4,500 naturally produced spawners and a spawner:spawner ratio
greater than 1:1 distributed among the three populations".  The minimum
number of naturally produced spawners (expressed as 12 year geometric
means) should exceed 2,000 each for the Wenatchee and Methow River
populations and 500 within the Entiat River.  Minimum productivity
thresholds were also established in the Plan.  The 12-year geometric
mean productivity should exceed 1.2 spawners per parent spawner for the
two larger populations (Wenatchee and Methow Rivers), and 1.4 for the
smaller Entiat River population.  The ICTRT had recommended that at
least two of the three extant populations be targeted for highly viable
status (less than 1% risk of extinction over 100 years) because of the
relatively low number of extant populations remaining in the ESU.  The
UC Plan adopted an alternative approach for addressing the limited
number of populations in the ESU -- 5% or less risk of extinction for
all three extant populations. 

The Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Plan also calls for '... restoring
the distribution of naturally produced spring Chinook salmon and
steelhead to previously occupied areas where practical; and conserving
their genetic and phenotypic diversity."   Specific criteria included in
the UCSRB Plan reflect a combination of the specific criteria
recommended by the ICTRT (ICTRT 2007) and in the earlier QAR effort
(Ford *et al.* 2001).  The Plan incorporates spatial structure criteria
specific to each spring Chinook salmon population.  For the Wenatchee
River population, the criteria call for observed natural spawning in
four of the five major spawning areas as well as in at least one of the
minor spawning areas downstream of Tumwater Dam.  In the Methow River,
natural spawning should be observed in three major spawning areas.  In
each case, the major spawning areas should include a minimum of 5% of
the total return to the system or 20 redds, whichever is greater.  The
Entiat River Spring Chinook population includes a single historical
major spawning area.

: Table . 15-year trends in log wild spawner abundance computed from a
linear regression applied to the smoothed wild spawner log abundance
estimate. Only populations with at least 4 wild spawner estimates from
1980 to 2014 are shown and with at least 2 data points in the first 5
years and last 5 years of the 15-year period.

##Recovery Update

The UCSRB Plan calls for meeting or exceeding the same basic spatial
structure and diversity criteria adopted from the ICTRT viability report
for recovery. 

Overall abundance and productivity (A/P) remains rated at high risk for
the each of the three extant populations in this MPG/ESU (Table 5).  The
10-year geometric mean abundance of adult natural-origin spawners has
not changed by more than 25% relative to the levels reported in the 2015
status update. Natural origin escapements still remains well below the
corresponding ICTRT thresholds for all populations.  The combinations of
current abundance and productivity for each population result in a high
risk rating when compared to the ICTRT viability curves.

The composite spatial structure/diversity (SS/D) risks for all three of
the extant populations in this MPG are rated at high (Table 5).  The
spatial processes component of the SS/D risk is low for the Wenatchee
and Methow river populations and moderate for the Entiat River (due to a
loss of production in lower section which increases effective distance
to other populations).  All three of the extant populations in this MPG
are rated at high risk for diversity, driven primarily by chronically
high proportions of hatchery-origin spawners in natural spawning areas
and lack of genetic diversity among the natural-origin spawners (ICTRT
2007).

Based on the combined ratings for A/P and SS/D, all three of the extant
populations of Upper Columbia spring Chinook salmon remain rated at high
overall risk (Table 5).

## Updated biological risk summary

Current estimates of natural origin spawner abundance decreased
substantially relative to the levels observed in the prior review for
all three extant populations. Productivities also continued to be very
low and both abundance and productivity remained well below the viable
thresholds called for in the Upper Columbia Recovery Plan for all three
populations.  Short-term patterns in those indicators appear to be
largely driven by year-to year fluctuations in survival rates in areas
outside of these watersheds, in particular a recent run of poor ocean
condition years.  All three populations continued to be rated at low
risk for spatial structure but at high risk for diversity criteria. 
Large-scale supplementation efforts in the Methow and Wenatchee Rivers
are ongoing, intended to counter short-term demographic risks given
current average survival levels and the associated year-to-year
variability.  Under the current recovery plan, habitat protection and
restoration actions are being implemented that are directed at key
limiting factors. 

Given the high degree of year-to-year variability in life stage
survivals and the time lags resulting from the 5-year life cycle of the
populations, it is not possible to detect incremental gains from habitat
actions implemented to date in population level measures of adult
abundance or productivity.  Efforts are underway to develop life stage
specific estimates of performance (survival and capacities) and to use a
life cycle model framework to evaluate progress (Zabel & Jordan 2020,
chapter 6).  Based on the information available for this review, the
risk category for the Upper Columbia Spring Chinook ESU remains
unchanged from the prior review (NWFSC 2015).  Although the viability of
the ESU remains improved relative to measures available at the time of
listing, all three populations remain at high risk.
