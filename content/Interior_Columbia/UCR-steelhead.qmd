title: "Upper Columbia River steelhead DPS"
---

## Brief description of DPS

The Upper Columbia Steelhead DPS includes all naturally spawned
anadromous *O. mykiss* (steelhead) populations below natural and manmade
impassable barriers in streams in the Columbia River Basin upstream from
the Yakima River, Washington, to the US-Canada border, as well as six
artificial propagation programs (85 FR 81822 and Figure 10). The Upper
Columbia Steelhead DPS was originally listed under the ESA in 1997; it
is currently designated as threatened.

NOAA Fisheries has defined DPSs of steelhead to include only the
anadromous members of this species (70 FR 67130). Our approach to
assessing the current viability of a steelhead DPS is based on
evaluating information on the abundance, productivity, spatial structure
and diversity of the anadromous component of the species (Good *et al*.
2005; 85 FR 81822). Many steelhead populations along the West Coast of
the U.S. co-occur with conspecific populations of resident rainbow
trout. We recognize that there may be situations where reproductive
contributions from resident rainbow trout may mitigate short-term
extinction risk for some steelhead DPSs (Good *et al.* 2005); 85 FR
81822). We assume that any benefits to an anadromous population
resulting from the presence of a conspecific resident form will be
reflected in direct measures of the current viability of the anadromous
form.

## Summary of previous viability conclusions

*2005*

The 2005 BRT cited low growth rate/productivity as the most serious risk
factor for the Upper Columbia River steelhead DPS (Good *et al.* 2005).
In particular, the BRT concluded that the extremely low replacement rate
of natural spawners highlighted in the 1998 review continued through the
subsequent brood cycle. The 2005 BRT assessment also identified very low
natural spawner abundance compared to interim escapement objectives and
high levels of hatchery spawners in natural areas as contributing risk
factors. The 2005 BRT report did note that the number of naturally
produced steelhead returning to spawn within this DPS had increased over
the levels reported in the 1998 status review. As with the Mid-Columbia
and Snake River DPS reviews, the 2005 BRT recognized that resident *O.
mykiss* were associated with anadromous steelhead production areas for
this DPS. The review stated that the presence of resident *O. mykiss*
was considered a mitigating factor by many of the BRT members in rating
extinction risk.

*2010*

The 2010 status review update reported that Upper Columbia steelhead
populations had increased in natural origin abundance in recent years,
but productivity levels remained low (Ford *et al.* 2011). The
proportions of hatchery origin returns in natural spawning areas
remained extremely high across the DPS, especially in the Methow and
Okanogan River populations. The modest improvements in natural returns
that had been observed the years prior to the review were probably
primarily the result of several years of relatively good natural
survival in the ocean and tributary habitats. Tributary habitat actions
called for in the Upper Columbia Recovery Plan were anticipated to be
implemented over the next 25 years and the benefits of some of those
actions would require some time to be realized. Overall, the new
information considered did not indicate a change in the biological risk
category since the time of the last BRT status review. 

*2015*

Based on the review in 2015, Upper Columbia River steelhead populations
were determined to have increased relative to the low levels observed in
the 1990s, but natural origin abundance and productivity remained well
below viability thresholds for three out of the four populations (NWFSC
2015). The viability of the Wenatchee River steelhead population
continued to improve based on the additional years information available
for this review. The abundance and productivity viability rating for the
Wenatchee River exceeds the minimum threshold for 5% extinction risk.
However, the overall DPS viability remains unchanged from the prior
review, remaining at high risk driven by low abundance and productivity
relative to viability objectives and diversity concerns. Application of
the criteria for abundance/productivity results in relatively coarse
scale ratings for each population. Across Interior Columbia DPSs, the
populations differ in the relative changes in survival or limiting
capacities that could lead to viable ratings. The required improvement
to improve the abundance/productivity estimates for Upper Columbia
Steelhead populations is at the high end of the range for all listed
Interior populations.

## Description of new data available for this review

The 2015 NWFSC status review (NWFSC 2015) evaluated the viability of the
Upper Columbia Steelhead DPS based on data series through cycle year
2013/2014 for each of the four extant populations, along with sampling
information collected at Priest Rapids Dam for the aggregate return to
the Upper Columbia Basin and Wells Dam (Methow and Okanogan populations
combined). Estimates generated using that methodology are currently
available through the 2018/2019 cycle years for each population.
Spawning escapement estimates are based on a run reconstruction model
incorporating annual dam counts, results of a three year radio tracking
program and estimates of broodstock and fisheries removals in various
reaches above Rock Island Dam. Estimates are generated by WDFW regional
staff (incorporating information from the Colville Tribal Fish &
Wildlife Department) and are available through the StreamNet Coordinated
Assessment Project website. An updated approach for estimating
population level escapements has been initiated in recent years. That
approach uses mark/recapture statistics based on data generated from the
combination of systematic PIT tagging of a target proportion of the
returns passing Rock Island Dam (below all four population spawning
tributaries) and subsequent detections at arrays in each of the
tributaries (Waterhouse *et al.* 2020). Comparisons of the results from
the updated approach with the methods used in prior years indicate they
generally produce compatible estimates for a given year. Preliminary
results are included in this assessment, in parallel to the ongoing data
collection based population assessments, with the understanding that
ongoing methodological and data evaluations will result in a single
approach to annual population enumeration in the future.

*Smolt to Adult Return and Recruits per Spawner Rates*

Smolt to Adult Return (SAR) estimates (Bonneville to Bonneville) for all
four Upper Columbia River Steelhead population data series are generated
by the Columbia River Data Access in Real Time (CBR, 2020) project using
PIT tag detections from all release locations within each population
basin (Columbia River DART, 2020). The indices represent cumulative
marine, nearshore and estuary survival. The SAR series includes
estimates for the range of brood years 2002-2015 (Figure 11). Over the
period of record, the geometric mean SAR for the Entiat, Methow and
Okanogan populations (\~3%) represents a low, but reasonable marine
survival (2% is generally considered a minimal replacement rate), with
the Wenatchee SAR of \~5% being a robust rate for a stable population.
Recruits per Spawner (R/S) indices are reported as available from the
StreamNet Coordinated Assessments data portal (StreamNet, 2020a). All
populations in the ESU have low (\< 1.0) R/S values, implying that the
natural replacement rate is not keeping up with all sources of mortality
across the life-cycle.

each population, along with the standard error of the estimate (whiskers
represent +/- one standard error). The time period included in the SAR
or R/S indices is the past 20 years, depending on data availability.

*Ocean Condition Indices*

Juvenile steelhead are more pelagic than salmon, heading off the
continental shelf soon after entering the ocean in the spring (Burgner
1992). Steelhead migrate seasonally across the North Pacific Ocean,
moving to the north and west in spring and to the south and east, across
the entire Pacific, from autumn through winter (Atcheson *et al.* 2012).
Thus, steelhead ocean survival may be impacted by different factors than
salmon. In fact, recent work has shown steelhead population groupings
from geographic regions have unique smolt survival trends that appear to
be driven by factors affecting them early in their ocean residence
despite steelhead smolts generally being larger than Pacific salmon
smolts when they enter the ocean and all making wide-ranging, off the
continental shelf migrations, rather than remaining more coastal, as
Pacific salmon smolts tend to do (Kendall *et al.* 2017).

Aggregate annual returns of Columbia River steelhead are correlated with
a range of ocean condition indices including measures of broad scale
physical conditions, local biological indicators, and local physical
factors (Peterson *et al.* 2014a). Work is ongoing to relate indices of
ocean condition to steelhead populations up and down the West Coast.
Steelhead marine survival seems to be related to ocean surface
temperature in the first summer of ocean entry, and populations respond
similarly to spatial patterns of ocean conditions at a rough grain of
250km between ocean entry points (Kendall *et al.* 2017). Therefore,
broad spatial patterns of ocean conditions may not capture the finer
spatial scale of response that steelhead seem to exhibit.

Indicators of ocean condition are highly correlated with each other, and
exhibit strong temporal autocorrelation (Figure 129, (Peterson *et al.*
2019)). As a result, when indicators point to conditions that result in
poor ocean productivity for salmonid populations, they do so as a suite
of indicators, and for runs of 'good' or 'bad' years (see Habitat
chapter). Historically, ocean conditions cycled between periods of high
and low productivity. However, global climate change is likely to
disrupt this pattern, in general, leading to a preponderance of low
productivity years, with an unknown temporal distribution (Crozier *et
al.* 2019b). Recent (2015-2019) ensemble ocean indicators rankings
include four of the worst seven years in the past 20, meaning that an
entire salmon or steelhead generation could have been subjected to poor
ocean productivity conditions.

## Abundance and productivity

Updated data series on spawner abundance, age structure and hatchery
wild proportions were used to generate current assessments of abundance
and productivity at the population level. Evaluations were done using
both a set of metrics corresponding to those used in prior ESA Status
Reviews as well as a set corresponding to the specific viability
criteria based on ICTRT recommendations for this DPS. The standard
Status Review metrics were consistently done across all ESUs and DPSs to
facilitate comparisons across domains. Assessments using the ICTRT
metrics are described in the TRT and Recovery Plan Criteria section
below. The ICTRT abundance and productivity metrics are measured over
longer time frames to dampen the effects of annual variations and they
use annual natural origin age composition to calculate brood year
recruitment when sampling levels meet regional fishery agency criteria.

The most recent estimates (5-year geometric mean) of total and
natural-origin spawner abundance have declined dramatically, erasing
gains observed over the past two decades for all four populations
(Figure 12, Table 6). Recent declines are persistent and large enough to
result in small, but negative 15-year trends in abundance for all four
populations (Table 7). Updated spawner estimation methods show a strong
concordance with existing methods (Figure 13), which is extremely
encouraging as the estimation process based on detecting tags from a
run-at-large tagging program is a very robust approach to monitoring
across the DPS. Annual brood year return-per-spawner estimates have been
well below replacement in recent years for all four populations. The
return per spawner estimates summarized in Figure 14 are ratios of the
estimated natural origin returns produced from spawners in each brood
year, under the assumption that both hatchery and natural origin fish
contribute to production as parent spawners. All populations are
consistently exhibiting natural production rates well below replacement,
and natural production has also declined consistently, resulting in an
increasing fraction of hatchery fish on the spawning grounds each year. 

The required improvement to increase abundance and productivity for
Upper Columbia Steelhead populations is at the high end of the range for
all listed Interior populations. Using the R/S and SAR indicators by
population (Figure 15), it is possible to generate an indicator of fresh
water productivity (FWPI) as a ratio of R/S and SAR. This quantity can
be thought of as an indicator of smolts per spawner, and thus, the
overall population productivity in the freshwater environment. FWPI for
Upper Columbia steelhead populations are very low (\<\<100, Figure 15),
confirming areas of recovery action focus such as pre-spawn mortality
and juvenile rearing habitat condition, as well as mainstem migratory
impacts as the SAR are based on Bonneville to Bonneville tag detections
and the R/S are based on spawning ground recruits. The initial ICTRT
assessment of abundance/productivity gaps resulted in a pattern similar
to that indicated by the long-term productivity metrics (ICTRT 2007,).
The Wenatchee River population has somewhat higher productivity (SAR,
R/S, and FWPI) than the remaining populations in the DPS, but still
falls into a high risk category due to the recent downward trend in both
abundance and productivity.

## Spatial structure and diversity

With the exception of the Okanogan population, the upper Columbia River
populations were rated as low risk for spatial structure. The high risk
ratings for diversity are largely driven by high levels of hatchery
spawners within natural spawning areas and lack of genetic diversity
among the populations. The basic major life history patterns (summer
A-run type, tributary and mainstem spawning/rearing patterns, and the
presence of resident populations and subpopulations) appear to be
present. All of the populations were rated at high risk for current
genetic characteristics by the ICTRT. Genetics samples taken in the
1980s indicate little differentiation within populations in the upper
Columbia River DPS. More recent studies within the Wenatchee River basin
have found differences between samples from the Peshastin River,
believed to be relatively isolated from hatchery spawning, and those
from other reaches within the Wenatchee. This suggests that there may
have been a higher level of within and among population diversity prior
to the advent of major hatchery releases (Seamons *et al.* 2012).
Genetic studies based on sampling in the Wenatchee as well as other
Upper Columbia River steelhead population tributaries are underway and
should allow for future analyses of current genetic structure and any
impacts of changing hatchery release practices. 

Hatchery-origin returns continue to constitute a high fraction of total
spawners in natural spawning areas for this DPS (Table 8). The estimated
proportion of natural-origin spawners has increased consistently since
the late 1990s for all four populations (Figure 16). Natural-origin
proportions were the highest in the Wenatchee River (58%). Although
increasing, natural origin proportions in the Methow and Okanogan rivers
remained at low levels. There are currently direct releases of hatchery
origin juveniles in three of the four populations, the exception being
the Entiat River. Based on PIT detections, hatchery origin spawners in
the Entiat River include stray hatchery returns from releases into the
Wenatchee River (Hillman *et al.* 2015). Reproductive effectiveness
studies on the Wenatchee population indicate that hatchery-hatchery
matings have dramatically reduced fitness compared to matings among
natural-origin fish (Ford *et al.* 2016), reinforcing the weight the
ICTRT placed on the presence of hatchery origin spawners in the Spatial
Structure and Diversity metric.

## Non-treaty Harvest

Steelhead were historically taken in tribal and non-tribal gillnet
fisheries, and in recreational fisheries in the mainstem Columbia River
and in tributaries. In the 1970s, retention of steelhead in non-treaty
commercial fisheries was prohibited, and in the mid 1980s, tributary
recreational fisheries in Washington adopted mark-selective regulations.
There is incidental mortality associated with mark-selective
recreational fisheries. Sport fisheries targeting hatchery run steelhead
occur in the mainstem Columbia River and in several Upper Columbia River
tributaries. In recent years, Upper Columbia River exploitation rates
have been stable at around 1.5%. As of 2012, rates are estimated over
two management intervals per year, Fall and Winter/Spring/Summer (Figure
17).

## Biological viability relative to recovery goals

NOAA Fisheries adopted a recovery plan for upper Columbia River spring
Chinook salmon and steelhead in 2007 (FR 72 #194, 57303−57307). The plan
was developed by the Upper Columbia Salmon Recovery Board (UCSRB) and is
available at:
https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/recovery-plan-upper-columbia-spring-chinook-salmon-and-steelhead.

Achieving recovery (delisting) of each ESU via sufficient improvement in
abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity is the longer
term goal of the UC Recovery Plan. The UC Recovery Plan includes
specific quantitative criteria expressed relative to population
viability curves (ICTRT 2007). It includes two quantitative criteria for
assessing the viability of the steelhead DPS against the recovery
objective: "The 12-year geometric mean (representing approximately three
generations) of abundance and productivity of naturally produced
steelhead within the Wenatchee, Entiat, and Methow populations must
reach a level that would have not less than a 5% extinction-risk
(viability) over a 100 year period" and "at a minimum, the Upper
Columbia Steelhead DPS will maintain at least 3,000 naturally produced
spawners and a spawner:spawner ratio greater than 1:1 distributed among
the three populations." The minimum number of naturally produced
spawners (expressed as 12-year geometric means) should exceed 1,000 each
for the Wenatchee and Methow river populations and 500 each for the
Entiat and Okanogan river populations. The plan also established minimum
productivity thresholds. These natural spawner abundance criteria
replace the interim targets referenced in the 2005 BRT report. The
12-year geometric mean productivity should exceed 1.1 spawners per
parent spawner for the two larger populations (Wenatchee and Methow
Rivers), and 1.2 for the smaller Entiat River and Okanogan populations. 

The ICTRT had recommended that at least two of the four extant
populations be targeted for highly viable status (less than 1% risk of
extinction over 100 years) because of the relatively low number of
extant populations remaining in the DPS. The UC Recovery Plan adopted an
alternative approach for addressing the limited number of populations in
the DPS---5% or less risk of extinction for at least three of the four
extant populations.

The UC Recovery Plan also calls for "... restoring the distribution of
naturally produced spring Chinook salmon and steelhead to previously
occupied areas where practical, and conserving their genetic and
phenotypic diversity." Specific criteria included in the UC Recovery
Plan reflect a combination of the criteria recommended by the ICTRT
(ICTRT 2007) and an earlier pre-TRT analytical project (Ford *et al.*
2001). The plan incorporates spatial structure criteria specific to each
steelhead population. For the Wenatchee River population, the criteria
require observed natural spawning in four of the five major spawning
areas as well as in at least one of the minor spawning areas downstream
of Tumwater Dam. In the Methow River, natural spawning should be
observed in three major spawning areas. In each case, the major spawning
areas should include a minimum of 5% of the total return to the system
or 20 redds, whichever is greater. In the Entiat, natural spawning
should be observed in both historical major spawning areas, with a
distribution criteria similar to the Methow. In the Okanogan, natural
spawning should be observed within the two major spawning areas and
within at least two of the five minor spawning areas, with a numerical
distribution similar to the Methow, across the minor spawning areas. The
plan incorporates criteria for spatial structure and diversity adopted
from the ICTRT viability report. The mean score for the three metrics
representing natural rates and spatially mediated processes should
result in a moderate or lower risk in each of the three populations and
all threats defined as high risk must be addressed. In addition, the
mean score for the eight ICTRT metrics tracking natural levels of
variation should result in a moderate or lower risk score at the
population level.

: Table . 5-year geometric mean of raw natural origin spawner counts.
This is the raw total spawner count times the fraction natural origin
estimate, if available. In parentheses, 5-year geometric mean of raw
total spawner counts is shown. A value only in parentheses means that a
total spawner count was available but no or only one estimate of natural
origin spawners available. The geometric mean was computed as the
product of counts raised to the power 1 over the number of counts
available (2 to 5). A minimum of 2 values were used to compute the
geometric mean. Percent change between the most recent two 5-year
periods is shown on the far right.

## Updated biological risk summary

Given the recent changes in hatchery practices in the Wenatchee River
and the potential for reduced hatchery contributions or increased
spatial separation of hatchery vs. natural origin spawners, it is
possible that genetic composition could trend towards patterns
consistent with strong natural selection influences in the future.
Ongoing genetic sampling and analysis could provide information in the
future to determine if the diversity risk is abating. The proportions of
hatchery-origin returns in natural spawning areas remain high across the
DPS, especially in the Methow and Okanogan river populations. Tributary
habitat actions called for in the Upper Columbia Recovery Plan are
anticipated to be implemented over the next 25 years and the benefits of
some of those actions will require some time to be realized. 

The most recent estimates (5-year geometric mean) of total and
natural-origin spawner abundance have declined since the last report,
largely erasing gains observed over the past two decades for all four
populations (Figure 12, Table 6). Recent declines are persistent and
large enough to result in small, but negative 15-year trends in
abundance for all four populations (Table 7). The abundance and
productivity viability rating for the Wenatchee River exceeds the
minimum threshold for 5% extinction risk. The overall DPS viability
remains unchanged from the prior review, remaining at high risk driven
by low abundance and productivity relative to viability objectives and
diversity concerns (Table 9).
