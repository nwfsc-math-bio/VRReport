title: ESU boundaries
---

In the 2015 report NWFSC (2015) recommended a revision of the Lower
Columbia River Steelhead DPS and Upper Willamette River Steelhead DPS
boundaries.  Specifically, that the Clackamas River winter steelhead
demographically independent population (DIP) originally included as part
of the Lower Columbia River DPS, instead be included in the Upper
Willamette River DPS. Genetic research published since 2015 further
supports the closer affinity of the Clackamas River winter-run steelhead
DIP to Upper Willamette River steelhead DPS populations rather than
Lower Columbia River steelhead DPS populations (Winans *et al.* 2018). 
We believe that the rationale for revising the placement of the
Clackamas River winter steelhead DIP originally stated in the 2015
Status Review is still accurate and appropriate and does not need
further review or revision.
